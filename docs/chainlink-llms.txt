Last Updated: 2025-12-18


This page documents the service quotas for Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) workflows.

> **NOTE: Subject to change**
>
> The quotas documented on this page are subject to change. Check back regularly for updates.

## Per-owner quotas

These quotas apply to each workflow owner (user account) within an organization.

| Quota Key                                                                                                                                              | Description                                                 | Value |

> **NOTE: Quota enforcement**
>
> When workflow executions exceed the quotas defined above, they are queued and automatically retried for up to 10
> minutes. If an execution cannot be completed within this 10-minute window, it will be dropped and will not run.

Last Updated: 2025-11-04


> **NOTE: First time here?**
>
> Before you begin, we strongly recommend reading the [**About CRE**](/cre/) page to understand the fundamental concepts
> of the platform, such as the trigger-and-callback model.

This multi-part tutorial guides you through building a complete workflow from a blank slate.

### What you'll build

You will build a simple but powerful **"Onchain Calculator"** workflow. By the end of this tutorial, your workflow will:

1. Run on a schedule using the **Cron Trigger**.
2. Fetch a random number from a public API using the **HTTP Capability**.
3. Read a value from a smart contract using the **EVM Read Capability**.
4. Combine the two values and write the final result back to the blockchain using the **EVM Write Capability**.

This tutorial is designed to teach you the core features of the CRE SDK in a logical progression. You can use any of the supported languages, Go or TypeScript using the language selector. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the end-to-end development process for building and simulating workflows that interact with both offchain and onchain data sources.

## Consensus Computing
Source: https://docs.chain.link/cre/concepts/consensus-computing

# Consensus Computing in CRE
Source: https://docs.chain.link/cre/concepts/consensus-computing
Last Updated: 2025-11-04


**Consensus computing** is the foundational computing paradigm that makes CRE secure and reliable. It ensures that every operation your workflow performs—whether fetching data from an API or reading from a blockchain—is verified by multiple independent nodes before producing a final result.

## What is consensus computing?

Consensus computing is when a decentralized network of nodes must form consensus as part of executing code and storing information. Unlike traditional computing where you trust a single server or service, consensus computing provides unique guarantees:

- **Tamper-resistance**: No single node can manipulate results
- **High availability**: The network continues operating even if individual nodes fail
- **Trust minimization**: You don't need to trust any single entity
- **Verifiability**: All results are cryptographically verified

Blockchains pioneered consensus computing for maintaining asset ledgers and executing smart contracts. CRE extends this paradigm to **any offchain operation**—API calls, computations, and more.

## How CRE uses consensus

In CRE, **every execution capability automatically includes decentralized consensus**. Here's how it works:

1. **Independent execution**: When your workflow invokes a capability (like `http.Client` or `evm.Client`), each node in the dedicated capability DON performs the operation independently
2. **Result collection**: Each node produces its own result based on what it observed
3. **Consensus protocol**: The DON applies a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol to validate and aggregate the individual results
4. **Verified output**: A single, consensus-verified result is returned to your workflow

This process happens automatically for every capability call. You don't need to write any special code—consensus is built into the CRE runtime environment.

## Why this matters for your workflows

### Protection against node failures and manipulation

CRE's consensus model protects against individual node failures and malicious behavior. When multiple independent nodes execute the same operation:

- **Node-level resilience**: If some nodes fail or go offline, the network continues operating
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Even if some nodes are compromised and return incorrect results, the honest majority ensures the correct outcome
- **Execution consistency**: All nodes must execute your workflow logic identically, preventing manipulation by individual operators

### Validated and verified results

Every result your workflow receives has been cryptographically verified and validated across multiple nodes. This provides strong guarantees that:

- The operation was executed correctly
- The result matches what independent observers agreed upon
- No single node operator can manipulate your workflow's execution or outputs

### Unified security model

With CRE, your **entire institutional-grade smart contract**—not just the onchain parts—benefits from consensus computing. This means:

- **API responses** are validated across multiple nodes before your workflow uses them
- **Blockchain reads** are verified by multiple nodes
- **Blockchain writes** are validated by multiple nodes before being submitted onchain
- **Computation results** within your workflow are executed consistently across all nodes

Your workflow inherits the same security and reliability guarantees as blockchain transactions, but for any offchain operation.

## Consensus in practice

### HTTP capability

When your workflow makes an API request using `http.Client`, the HTTP capability DON executes your request across multiple nodes. Their responses are validated through a consensus protocol before returning a result to your workflow.

This ensures:

- Execution consistency across all nodes
- Protection against individual node compromise or failure
- Detection of inconsistent API responses (e.g., due to load balancing or timing)

See the [HTTP Capability](/cre/capabilities/http) page for details.

### EVM Read & Write capability

When your workflow reads from or writes to a blockchain using `evm.Client`, the EVM capability DON performs the operation across multiple nodes:

- **For reads**: Multiple nodes independently query the blockchain, and consensus validates their responses match
- **For writes**: Multiple nodes agree on the transaction data before submitting it onchain

This ensures:

- Execution consistency across all nodes
- Protection against individual node compromise or failure
- Validated blockchain data before use in your workflow

See the [EVM Read & Write Capability](/cre/capabilities/evm-read-write) page for details.

## Consensus in simulation vs. deployed workflows

> **NOTE: Understanding consensus during development**
>
> **In local simulation** (`cre workflow simulate`), consensus uses a single-node model to test your workflow's logic quickly. The "consensus" step still occurs, but involves a single node wrapping its result in a standardized report structure. This allows you to build and test against the final SDK interfaces without the overhead of multi-node consensus.

**In deployed workflows**, true multi-node Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus is performed across all capability DON operations, providing full decentralized security guarantees.

Blockchain interoperability protocols are important for the Web3 ecosystem and traditional systems that need to interact with different blockchains. These protocols are the foundation for building blockchain abstraction layers, allowing traditional backends and dApps to interact with any blockchain network through a single middleware solution. Without a blockchain interoperability protocol, Web2 systems and dApps would need to build separate in-house implementations for each cross-chain interaction that they want to use, which is a time-consuming, resource-intensive, and complex process.

Blockchain interoperability protocols provide the following capabilities:

- You can transfer assets and information across multiple blockchains.
- Application developers can leverage the strengths and benefits of different chains.
- Collaboration between developers from diverse blockchain ecosystems enables the building of cross-chain applications to serve more users and provide additional features or products for them.

The *Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)* provides these capabilities and enables a variety of [use cases](#common-use-cases).

## What is Chainlink CCIP?

Chainlink CCIP is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications that can transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains.

Given the [inherent risks of cross-chain interoperability](/resources/bridge-risks), CCIP features [defense-in-depth security](https://blog.chain.link/five-levels-cross-chain-security/#level_5__defense-in-depth) and is powered by Chainlink's industry-standard oracle networks which have a proven track record of securing tens of billions of dollars and enabling over $14 trillion in onchain transaction value.

CCIP's robust security framework is built upon several core components:

- **Proven Decentralized Architecture**: CCIP leverages the same highly reliable infrastructure as Chainlink Data Feeds, which has enabled trillions in transaction value across hundreds of DeFi applications. Cross-chain transactions are validated by multiple decentralized oracle networks (DONs).
- **Rate Limiting**: To mitigate risk, CCIP includes a rate limiting feature. This allows owners to establish and configure policies for Cross-Chain Tokens, which are then enforced on both the source and destination chains.
- **Timelocked Upgrades**: All on-chain, security-critical configuration changes and core infrastructure upgrades must pass through a Role-based Access Control Timelock contract. This process provides a review period during which CCIP node operators can veto the upgrade, or, in time-sensitive situations, explicitly approve it.
- **High-Quality, Sybil-Resistant Node Operators**: The system is secured by the same globally distributed, security-reviewed, public node operators that secure other Chainlink services, validate leading blockchain networks, and operate traditional Web2 infrastructure. Each independent CCIP node is run by a distinct organization with extensive DevOps expertise and rigorous private key management security practices.

To understand how Chainlink CCIP works, refer to the [architecture](/ccip/concepts/architecture/overview) section. If you are new to using Chainlink CCIP, read these guides before you deploy any contracts that use CCIP.

## Chainlink CCIP core capabilities

Chainlink CCIP supports three main capabilities:

### Arbitrary Messaging

The ability to send arbitrary data (encoded as bytes) to a receiving smart contract on a different blockchain. The developer is free to encode any data they wish to send.

Typically, developers use arbitrary messaging to trigger an informed action on the receiving smart contract, such as rebalancing an index, minting a specific NFT, or calling an arbitrary function with the sent data as custom parameters. Developers can encode multiple instructions in a single message, enabling them to orchestrate complex, multi-step, multi-chain tasks.

### Token Transfer

The ability to transfer tokens to an account on a different blockchain. This capability enables the seamless movement of assets across chains.

### Programmable Token Transfer

The ability to simultaneously transfer tokens and arbitrary data (encoded as bytes) within a single transaction. This mechanism allows users to transfer tokens and send instructions on what to do with those tokens.

For example, a user could transfer tokens to a lending protocol with instructions to leverage those tokens as collateral for a loan, borrowing another asset to be sent back to the user.

### Receiving account types

With CCIP, you send transactions with data (arbitrary messaging), tokens, or both data and tokens (programmable token transfer). The receiver of a CCIP transaction varies by blockchain family:

| CCIP capability             | What is sent    | Receiving account types                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arbitrary Messaging         | Data            | EVM: Smart contracts only<br />SVM: Programs only<br />Aptos: Modules only                                                                         |
| Token Transfer              | Tokens          | EVM: Smart contracts and EOAs<br />SVM: User wallets or program-controlled PDAs<br />Aptos: User accounts or modules deployed to resource accounts |
| Programmable Token Transfer | Data and tokens | EVM: Smart contracts only<br />SVM: Data to programs, tokens to program-controlled PDAs<br />Aptos: Modules deployed to resource accounts          |

**Note**: On EVM chains, EOAs cannot receive messages. On Solana (SVM), programs work with Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to manage token reception.

## Common use cases

Chainlink CCIP enables a variety of use cases:

- **Cross-chain lending:** Chainlink CCIP enables users to lend and borrow a wide range of crypto assets across multiple DeFi platforms running on independent chains.
- **Low-cost transaction computation:** Chainlink CCIP can help offload the computation of transaction data on cost-optimized chains.
- **Optimizing cross-chain yield:** Users can leverage Chainlink CCIP to move collateral to new DeFi protocols to maximize yield across chains.
- **Creating new kinds of dApps:** Chainlink CCIP enables users to take advantage of network effects on certain chains while harnessing compute and storage capabilities of other chains.

# CCIP Billing
Source: https://docs.chain.link/ccip/billing
Last Updated: 2025-05-19


> **NOTE: Prerequisites**
>
> Read the CCIP [Introduction](/ccip) and [Concepts](/ccip/concepts) to understand all the concepts discussed on this
> page.

The CCIP billing model uses the `feeToken` specified in the [message](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/client#evm2anymessage) to pay a single fee on the source blockchain. CCIP uses a gas-locked fee payment mechanism to help ensure the reliable execution of cross-chain transactions regardless of destination blockchain gas spikes. For developers, this means you can simply pay on the source blockchain and CCIP will take care of execution on the destination blockchain.

CCIP supports fee payments in LINK and in alternative assets, including blockchain-native gas tokens and their ERC-20 wrapped versions. The payment model for CCIP is designed to significantly reduce friction for users and quickly scale CCIP to more blockchains by supporting fee payments that originate across a multitude of blockchains over time.

Aside from billing, remember to [carefully estimate the `gasLimit` that you set](/ccip/concepts/best-practices/evm#setting-gaslimit) for your destination contract so CCIP can have enough gas to execute `ccipReceive()`, if applicable. Any unspent gas from this user-set limit is not refunded.

## Billing mechanism

The fee is calculated by the following formula:

```
fee = blockchain fee + network fee
```

Where:

- `fee`: The total fee for processing a [CCIP message](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/client#evm2anymessage). **Note:** Users can call the [getFee](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/i-router-client#getfee) function to estimate the fee.
- `blockchain fee`: This represents an estimation of the gas cost the node operators will pay to deliver the CCIP message to the destination blockchain.
- `network fee`: The fee paid to RMN node operators running the [Decentralized Oracle Network](/ccip/concepts/architecture/key-concepts#decentralized-oracle-network-don).

### Blockchain fee

The blockchain fee is calculated by the following formula:

```
blockchain fee = execution cost + data availability cost
```

#### Execution cost

The execution cost is directly correlated with the estimated gas usage to execute the transaction on the destination blockchain:

```
execution cost = gas price * gas usage * gas multiplier
```

Where:

- `gas price`: The destination gas price. CCIP maintains a cache of destination gas prices on each source blockchain, denominated in each `feeToken`.
- `gas multiplier`: Scaling factor. This multiplier ensures the reliable execution of transactions regardless of destination blockchain gas spikes.
- `gas usage`:

  ```
  gas usage = gas limit + destination gas overhead + destination gas per payload + gas for token transfers`
  ```

  Where:

  - `gas limit`: This specifies the maximum amount of gas CCIP can consume to execute [ccipReceive()](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/ccip-receiver#ccipreceive) on the receiver contract located on the destination blockchain. Users set the gas limit in the [extra argument field](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/client#genericextraargsv2) of the CCIP message. **Note:** Remember to [carefully estimate the `gasLimit` that you set](/ccip/concepts/best-practices/evm#setting-gaslimit) for your destination contract so CCIP can have enough gas to execute `ccipReceive()`. Any unspent gas from this user-set limit is not refunded.
  - `destination gas overhead`: This is the fixed gas cost incurred on the destination blockchain by CCIP (Committing DON + Executing DON) and Risk Management Network.
  - `destination gas per payload`: This variable gas depends on the length of the data field in the [CCIP message](/ccip/api-reference/evm/v1.6.1/client#evm2anymessage). If there is no payload (CCIP only transfers tokens), the value is `0`.
  - `gas for token transfers`: This variable gas cost is for transferring tokens onto the destination blockchain. If there are no token transfers, the value is `0`.

#### Data availability cost

This cost is only relevant if the destination blockchain is a [L2 layer](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-layer-2). Some L2s charge fees for [data availability](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-availability). For instance, [optimistic rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/) process the transactions offchain then post the transaction data to Ethereum as calldata, which costs additional gas.

### Network fee

The fee paid to node operators running the [Decentralized Oracle Network](/ccip/concepts/architecture/key-concepts#decentralized-oracle-network-don):

#### Token transfers or programmable token transfers

For token transfers or programmable token transfers (token + data), the network fee varies based on the [token handling mechanism](/ccip/concepts/cross-chain-token/overview#token-handling-mechanisms) and the lanes:

- **Lock and Unlock**: The network fee is percentage-based. For each token, it is calculated using the following expression:

  ```
  tokenAmount * price * percentage
  ```

  Where:

  - `tokenAmount`: The amount of tokens being transferred.
  - `price`: Initially priced in USD and converted into the `feeToken`.
  - `percentage`: The values are provided in the [network fee table](#network-fee-table).

- **Lock and Mint**, **Burn and Mint** and **Burn and Unlock**: The network fee is a static amount. See the [network fee table](#network-fee-table).

> **NOTE: Determine Token Handling Mechanism**
>
> Use the [calculator](#network-token-calculator) below or consult the CCIP Directory on the
> [mainnet](/ccip/directory/mainnet) or (/ccip/directory/testnet) pages to determine a token's handling mechanism on a
> given lane.

#### Messaging (only data)

For messaging (only data): The network fee is a static amount, denominated in USD. See the [network fee table](#network-fee-table).

#### Network fee table

The table below provides an overview of the network fees charged for different use cases on different lanes. Percentage-based fees are calculated on the value transferred in a message. USD-denominated fees are applied per message.

| Use case                                       | Token Pool Mechanism                            | Lanes             | LINK      | Others   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Token Transfers / Programmable Token Transfers | Lock and Unlock                                 | All Lanes         | 0.063 %   | 0.05 %   |

| Token Transfers / Programmable Token Transfers | Lock and Mint / Burn and Mint / Burn and Unlock | To: Ethereum      | 1.35 USD  | 1.50 USD |
| Messaging                                      | N/A                                             | Non-Ethereum      | 0.09 USD  | 0.10 USD |
| Messaging                                      | N/A                                             | From/To: Ethereum | 0.45 USD  | 0.50 USD |

# CCIP Test Tokens - Faucets for EVM and Solana
Source: https://docs.chain.link/ccip/test-tokens
Last Updated: 2025-08-19


import { SVMTestTokensClient } from "@features/ccip/components/faucet"
import CcipCommon from "@features/ccip/CcipCommon.astro"

CCIP provides test tokens that you can mint on testnets for development and testing.

## Quick Start

### EVM Chains

Call the `drip` function directly on token contracts using the interface below or through block explorers:

### Solana Devnet

Use the dedicated faucet interface for CCIP-BnM tokens:

#### Amount and rate limits

- The faucet mints **1 CCIP‑BnM** per request.
- Requests are **rate‑limited to about once every 3 hours per wallet**.

#### Signature requirement

The faucet requires wallet signature verification. When you request tokens, your wallet will prompt you to sign a message.

- Message signing is free (no SOL required) and grants no spending permissions.
- After signature verification, the server executes the token mint transaction.

## About CCIP Test Tokens

CCIP supports specialized test tokens designed for cross-chain testing. These tokens are available on all CCIP-supported testnets.

| Token        | Type        | Availability                                                        | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CCIP-BnM** | Burn & Mint | All testnets                                                        | Burned on source chain, minted on destination chain            |
| **CCIP-LnM** | Lock & Mint | Ethereum Sepolia (native)<br />Other chains (wrapped as clCCIP-LnM) | Locked on Ethereum Sepolia, minted as wrapped tokens elsewhere |

On EVM chains, tokens are minted by calling the `drip` function directly on contracts. On Solana Devnet, CCIP-BnM tokens are available through a dedicated faucet interface.

## LINK Token Faucets

For CCIP operations, you also need LINK tokens to pay transaction fees. Use the official [Chainlink faucets](https://faucets.chain.link/) to obtain LINK tokens on supported testnets by connecting your wallet.

## Block Explorer Method (EVM Chains)

For EVM chains, you call the `drip` function directly on token contracts. You can use block explorers instead of the interface above:

```solidity
function drip(address to) external {
  _mint(to, 1e18);
}
```

### General Process

Navigate to the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory/testnet) to find token contract addresses, open the contract on the appropriate block explorer, connect your wallet, and call the `drip` function with your wallet address.

### Example: Ethereum Sepolia CCIP-BnM

Locate the CCIP-BnM contract address in the [CCIP Directory](/ccip/directory/testnet) under [Ethereum Sepolia](/ccip/directory/testnet/chain/ethereum-testnet-sepolia). Open the [contract on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xFd57b4ddBf88a4e07fF4e34C487b99af2Fe82a05), navigate to the Contract tab, select Write Contract, and connect your wallet. Call the `drip` function with your wallet address to mint 1 CCIP-BnM token. Import the token in your wallet using this [MetaMask guide](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031#h_01FWH492CHY60HWPC28RW0872H).

> **NOTE: Talk to an expert**
>
> <a href="https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed">Contact us</a> to talk to an expert about integrating Chainlink
> Data Feeds with your applications.

Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to real-world data such as asset prices, reserve balances, and L2 sequencer health.

If you already started a project and need to integrate Chainlink, you can [add Chainlink to your existing project](/resources/create-a-chainlinked-project?parent=dataFeeds#installing-into-existing-projects) with the [`@chainlink/contracts` NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts).

## Types of data feeds

Data feeds provide many different types of data for your applications.

- [Price Feeds](#price-feeds)
- [SmartData Feeds](#smartdata-feeds)
  - [Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds](#multiple-variable-response-mvr-feeds)
- [Smart Value Recapture (SVR) Feeds](#smart-value-recapture-svr-feeds)
- [Rate and Volatility Feeds](#rate-and-volatility-feeds)
- [L2 sequencer uptime feeds](#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds)

### Price Feeds

Smart contracts often act in real-time on data such as prices of assets. This is especially true in [DeFi](https://chain.link/use-cases/defi).

For example, lending and borrowing platforms like [Aave](https://aave.com) utilize Data Feeds to assess collateral value accurately, while perpetual platforms such as [GMX](https://gmx.io) rely on these feeds to validate offchain data and ensure that each deposit or withdrawal executes at the correct market value.

Data Feeds aggregate many data sources and publish them onchain using a combination of the [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model?parent=dataFeeds) and [Offchain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting?parent=dataFeeds).

- To learn how to use Price Feeds, see the [Price Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) documentation.
- See the [Data Feeds Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses.

### SmartData Feeds

Chainlink SmartData is a suite of onchain data offerings designed to unlock the utility, accessibility, and reliability of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). By providing secure minting assurances alongside essential real-world data such as reserves, Net Asset Value (NAV), and Assets Under Management (AUM) data, the SmartData suite embeds security and enriches data into tokenized RWA offerings.

- To learn more about the broader SmartData suite, see the [SmartData](/data-feeds/smartdata) documentation.
- See the [SmartData Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses.

#### Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds

The SmartData suite includes [Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds), which bundle multiple data points of various types into a single onchain update. Unlike traditional feeds that provide only one numeric value, MVR feeds can return multiple values of different types (both numeric and non-numeric) in a single transaction.

- To learn more about MVR Feeds, see the [Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds) documentation.
- See the [SmartData Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses. Use the *Show Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) feeds* checkbox to filter the list.

### Smart Value Recapture (SVR) Feeds

Smart Value Recapture (SVR) Feeds introduce a mechanism to recapture Oracle Extractable Value (OEV), a form of MEV associated with oracle updates, often observed during liquidations.

- To learn more, see the [Smart Value Recapture (SVR) Feeds](/data-feeds/svr-feeds) documentation.
- Find SVR-enabled addresses on the [Price Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) page by filtering for SVR feeds.

### Rate and Volatility Feeds

Several feeds provide interest rate curve data, APY data, and realized asset price volatility.

- To learn more, see the [Rate and Volatility Feeds](/data-feeds/rates-feeds) documentation.
- See the [Rate and Volatility Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses.

### L2 sequencer uptime feeds

L2 sequencer feeds track the last known status of the sequencer on an L2 network at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by providing a grace period to allow customers to react to these events.

To learn how to use L2 sequencer uptime feeds, see the [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) documentation.

## Components of a data feed

Data Feeds are examples of decentralized oracle networks with different interfaces depending on the type of data they provide. Each feed type includes specific components:

### Single-value Feed Components

Data feeds that deliver a single numeric value (such as price feeds or single-value [SmartData feeds](/data-feeds/smartdata)) include the following components:

- **Consumer**: A consumer is an onchain or offchain application that uses Data Feeds. Consumer contracts use the [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) to call functions on the proxy contract and retrieve information from the aggregator contract. For a complete list of functions available in the `AggregatorV3Interface`, see the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference/#aggregatorv3interface).
- **Proxy contract**: Proxy contracts are onchain proxies that point to the aggregator for a particular data feed. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be upgraded without any service interruption to consuming contracts. Proxy contracts can vary from one data feed to another, but the [`EACAggregatorProxy.sol` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/EACAggregatorProxy.sol) on Github is a common example.
- **Aggregator contract**: An aggregator is a contract that receives periodic data updates from the oracle network. Aggregators store aggregated data onchain so that consumers can retrieve it and act upon it within the same transaction. For a complete list of functions and variables available on most aggregator contracts, see the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference/#accesscontrolledoffchainaggregator).

To learn how to create a consumer contract that uses an existing price feed, read the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) documentation.

### MVR Feed Components

[Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds), which deliver multiple data points of various types in a single bundle, include the following components:

- **Consumer**: A consumer is an onchain or offchain application that uses MVR Feeds. Consumer contracts use the [`IBundleAggregatorProxy`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference/#ibundleaggregatorproxy) interface to call functions on the proxy contract and retrieve bundle data.
- **Bundle Aggregator Proxy**: This proxy contract points to the underlying bundle aggregator. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be upgraded without service interruption to consuming contracts. The proxy exposes functions like [`latestBundle()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference/#latestbundle), [`bundleDecimals()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference/#bundledecimals), and [`latestBundleTimestamp()`](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference/#latestbundletimestamp) for consumers to access the bundled data.

To learn how to create a consumer contract that uses an existing MVR feed, read the [Using MVR Feeds on EVM Chains (Solidity)](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/guides/evm-solidity) guide.

## Reading proxy and aggregator configurations

Because the proxy and aggregator contracts are all onchain, you can see the current configuration by reading the variables through an [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) or using a blockchain explorer for your network. For example, you can see the [BTC/USD proxy configuration](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c#readContract) on the Ethereum network using Etherscan.

If you read the BTC/USD proxy configuration, you can query all of the functions and variables that are publicly accessible for that contract including the `aggregator` address, `latestRoundData()` function, `latestAnswer` variable, `owner` address, `latestTimestamp` variable, and several others. To see descriptions for the proxy contract variables and functions, see the source code for your specific data feed on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c#code#L568).

The proxy contract points to an aggregator. This allows you to retrieve data through the proxy even if the aggregator is upgraded. If you view the `aggregator` address defined in the proxy configuration, you can see the aggregator and its configuration. For example, see the [BTC/USD aggregator contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c#code) in Etherscan. This contract includes several variables and functions, including another `latestRoundData()`. To see descriptions for the aggregator variables and functions, see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol) or [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAe74faA92cB67A95ebCAB07358bC222e33A34dA7#code#F1#L1).

You can call the `latestRoundData()` function directly on the aggregator, but it is a best practice to use the proxy instead so that changes to the aggregator do not affect your application. Similar to the proxy contract, the aggregator contract has a `latestAnswer` variable, `owner` address, `latestTimestamp` variable, and several others.

## Components of an aggregator

The aggregator contract has several variables and functions that might be useful for your application. Although aggregator contracts are similar for each data feed, some aggregators have different variables. Use the `typeAndVersion()` function on the aggregator to identify what type of aggregator it is and what version it is running.

Always check the contract source code and configuration to understand how specific data feeds operate. For example, the [aggregator contract for BTC/USD on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x942d00008D658dbB40745BBEc89A93c253f9B882#code) is different from the aggregators on other networks.

For examples of the contracts that are typically used in aggregator deployments, see the [libocr repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/) on GitHub.

For a complete list of functions and variables available on most aggregator contracts, see the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference/#accesscontrolledoffchainaggregator).

## Updates to proxy and aggregator contracts

To accommodate the dynamic nature of offchain environments, Chainlink Data Feeds are updated from time to time to add new features and capabilities as well as respond to externalities such as token migrations, protocol rebrands, extreme market events, and upstream issues with data or node operations.

These updates include changes to the aggregator configuration or a complete replacement of the aggregator that the proxy uses. If you consume data feeds through the proxy, your applications can continue to operate during these changes.

Proxy and aggregator contracts all have an `owner` address that has permission to change variables and functions. For example, if you read the [BTC/USD proxy contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4030086522a5bEEa4988F8cA5B36dbC97BeE88c#readContract) in Etherscan, you can see the `owner` address. This address is a [multi-signature safe](https://docs.safe.global/getting-started/readme) (multisig) that you can also inspect.

If you [view the multisig contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21f73D42Eb58Ba49dDB685dc29D3bF5c0f0373CA#readProxyContract) in Etherscan using the *Read as Proxy* feature, you can see the full details of the multisig including the list of addresses that can sign and the number of signers required for the multisig to approve actions on any contracts that it owns.

The multisig-coordinated upgradability of Chainlink Data Feeds involves time-tested processes that balance collusion-resistance with the flexibility required to implement improvements and swiftly react to external conditions. The approach taken to upgradability will continue to evolve over time to meet user requirements.

## Monitoring data feeds

When you build applications and protocols that depend on data feeds, include monitoring and safeguards to protect against the negative impact of extreme market events, possible malicious activity on third-party venues or contracts, potential delays, and outages.

Create your own monitoring alerts based on deviations in the answers that data feeds provide. This will notify you when potential issues occur so you can respond to them.

### Check the latest answer against reasonable limits

The data feed aggregator includes both [`minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/9e4afd8896f365b964bdf769ca28f373a3fb0300/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol#L33). On most data feeds, these values are no longer used and they do not stop your application from reading the most recent answer. For monitoring purposes, you must decide what limits are acceptable for your application.

Configure your application to detect when the reported answer is close to reaching reasonable minimum and maximum limits so it can alert you to potential market events. Separately, configure your application to detect and respond to extreme price volatility or prices that are outside of your acceptable limits.

### Check the timestamp of the latest answer

Chainlink Data Feeds do not provide streaming data. Rather, the aggregator updates its `latestAnswer` when the value deviates beyond a specified threshold or when the heartbeat idle time has passed. You can find the heartbeat and deviation values for each data feed at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/) or in the [Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) lists.

Your application should track the `latestTimestamp` variable or use the `updatedAt` value from the `latestRoundData()` function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it. If your application detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat or within time limits that you determine are acceptable for your application, pause operation or switch to an alternate operation mode while identifying the cause of the delay.

When the node detects that the heartbeat is reached, it initiates the latest round. Depending on congestion and network conditions, there may be a slight delay for the latest round to get onchain.

During periods of low volatility, the heartbeat triggers updates to the latest answer. Some heartbeats are configured to last several hours, so your application should check the timestamp and verify that the latest answer is recent enough for your application.

Users should build applications with the understanding that data feeds for wrapped or liquid staking assets might have different heartbeat and deviation thresholds than that of the underlying asset. Heartbeat and deviation thresholds can also differ for the same asset across different blockchains. Combining data from multiple feeds, even those with a common denominator, might result in a margin of error that users must account for in their risk mitigation practices.

To learn more about the heartbeat and deviation threshold, read the [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model?parent=dataFeeds#aggregator) page.

# Data Feeds API Reference
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference


When you use data feeds, retrieve the feeds through the `AggregatorV3Interface` and the proxy address. Optionally, you can call variables and functions in the `AccessControlledOffchainAggregator` contract to get information about the aggregator behind the proxy.

## AggregatorV3Interface

Import this interface to your contract and use it to run functions in the proxy contract. Create the interface object by pointing to the proxy address. For example, on Sepolia you could create the interface object in the constructor of your contract using the following example:

```solidity
/**
 * Network: Sepolia
 * Data Feed: ETH/USD
 * Address: 0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306
 */
constructor() {
  priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306);
}

```

To see examples for how to use this interface, read the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) guide.

You can see the code for the [`AggregatorV3Interface` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) on GitHub.

## AccessControlledOffchainAggregator

This is the contract for the aggregator. You can call functions on the aggregator directly, but it is a best practice to use the [AggregatorV3Interface](#aggregatorv3interface) to run functions on the proxy instead so that changes to the aggregator do not affect your application. Read the aggregator contract only if you need functions that are not available in the proxy.

The aggregator contract has several variables and functions that might be useful for your application. Although aggregator contracts are similar for each data feed, some aggregators have different variables. Use the `typeAndVersion()` function on the aggregator to identify what type of aggregator it is and what version it is running.

Always check the contract source code and configuration to understand how specific data feeds operate. For example, the [aggregator contract for BTC/USD on Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x942d00008D658dbB40745BBEc89A93c253f9B882#code) is different from the aggregators on other networks.

For examples of the contracts that are typically used in aggregator deployments, see the [libocr repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/) on GitHub.

### Variables and functions in AccessControlledOffchainAggregator

This contract imports `OffchainAggregator` and `SimpleReadAccessController`, which also include their own imports. The variables and functions lists include the publicly accessible items from these imported contracts.

A simple way to read the variables or functions is to get the ABI from a blockchain explorer and point the ABI to the aggregator address. To do this in Remix, follow the [Using the ABI with AtAddress](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#using-the-abi-with-ataddress) guide in the Remix documentation. As an example, you can find the ABI for the BTC/USD aggregator by viewing the [contract code in Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAe74faA92cB67A95ebCAB07358bC222e33A34dA7#code).

**Variables:**

# Developer Responsibilities: Market Integrity and Application Code Risks
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/developer-responsibilities


Chainlink Data Feeds provide access to highly secure, reliable, and decentralized real-world data published onchain. The assets priced by Chainlink Data Feeds are subject to market conditions beyond the ability of Chainlink node operators to control, as such developers are responsible for ensuring that the operation and performance of Chainlink Data Feeds match expectations.

When integrating Chainlink Data Feeds, developers must understand that the performance of feeds is subject to risks associated with both market integrity and application code.

- **Market Integrity Risks** are those associated with external market conditions impacting price behavior and data quality in unanticipated ways. Developers are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating any potential market integrity risks.

- **Application Code Risks** are those associated with the quality, reliability, and dependencies of the code on which an application operates. Developers are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating any potential application code risks.

Please [refer to this guide for additional information](https://chain.link/education-hub/market-manipulation-vs-oracle-exploits) about market integrity risks and how developers can protect their applications.

## Developer Responsibilities

Developers are responsible for maintaining the security and user experience of their applications. They must also securely manage all interactions between their applications and third-party services.

In particular, developers implementing Chainlink Data Feeds in their code and applications are responsible for their application's market integrity and code risks that may cause unanticipated pricing data behavior. These are described below in more detail.

### Market Integrity Risks

Market conditions can impact the pricing behavior of assets in ways beyond the ability of Chainlink node operators to predict or control.

Market integrity risk factors can include but are not limited to, [market manipulation](https://chain.link/education-hub/market-manipulation-vs-oracle-exploits) such as Spoofing, Ramping, Bear Raids, Cross-Market Manipulation, Washtrading, and Frontrunning. All assets are susceptible to [market risk](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#data-feed-categories), but in particular, assets with high market risk, such as those with low liquidity, are the most vulnerable to market manipulation. Developers are solely responsible for accounting for such risk factors when integrating Chainlink Data Feeds into their applications. Developers should understand the market risks around the assets they intend their application to support before integrating associated Chainlink Data Feeds and inform their end users about applicable market risks.

Developers should reference the following additional information when implementing Chainlink Data Feeds:

- [Data Feed Categories](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#data-feed-categories) to evaluate market integrity risks associated with specific Chainlink Data Feeds Developers intend to integrate.
- [Evaluating Data Source Risks](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#evaluating-data-sources-and-risks) to evaluate risk mitigation techniques associated with Chainlink Data Feeds broadly.

### Application Code Risks

Developers implementing Chainlink Data Feeds are solely responsible for instituting the requisite [risk mitigation processes](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#risk-mitigation) including, but not limited to, data quality checks, circuit breakers, and appropriate contingency logic for their use case.

- **Code quality and reliability:** Developers must execute code using Chainlink Data Feeds only if the code meets the quality and reliability requirements for their use case and application.

- **Code and application audits:** Developers are responsible for auditing their code and applications before deploying to production. Developers must determine the quality of any audits and ensure that they meet the requirements for their application.

- **Code dependencies and imports:** Developers are responsible for ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of any dependencies or imported packages that they use with Chainlink Data Feeds, and review and audit these dependencies and packages.

## Getting Started with Data Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/getting-started

# Consuming Data Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/getting-started


You can use Chainlink Data Feeds to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data like the [ETH / USD feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd). These data feeds use data aggregated from many independent Chainlink node operators. Each price feed has an onchain address and functions that enable contracts to read pricing data from that address.

This guide shows you how to read Data Feeds and store the value onchain using Solidity. To learn how to read feeds offchain or use different languages, see the [Using Data Feeds on EVM Chains](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) guide. Alternatively, you can also learn how to use Data Feeds on [Solana](/data-feeds/solana) or [StarkNet](/data-feeds/starknet).

The code for reading Data Feeds on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible blockchains is the same for each chain and each Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for different uses, but the request and response format are the same. The answer decimal length and expected value ranges might change depending on what feed you use.

> **CAUTION: Using Data Feeds on L2 networks**
>
> If you are using Chainlink Data Feeds on L2 networks like Arbitrum, OP, and Metis, you must also check the latest
> answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event of an L2 sequencer outage.
> See the [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) page to learn how to use Data Feeds on L2
> networks.

## Before you begin

If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) before you start this guide.

## Examine the sample contract

This example contract obtains the latest price answer from the [BTC / USD feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) on the Sepolia testnet, but you can modify it to read any of the different [Types of Data Feeds](/data-feeds#types-of-data-feeds).

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES HARDCODED
 * VALUES FOR CLARITY.
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

/**
 * If you are reading data feeds on L2 networks, you must
 * check the latest answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime
 * Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event
 * of an L2 sequencer outage. See the
 * https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
 * page for details.
 */
contract DataConsumerV3 {
  AggregatorV3Interface internal dataFeed;

  /**
   * Network: Sepolia
   * Aggregator: BTC/USD
   * Address: 0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
   */
  constructor() {
    dataFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43);
  }

  /**
   * Returns the latest answer.
   */
  function getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer() public view returns (int256) {
    // prettier-ignore
    (
      /* uint80 roundId */
      ,
      int256 answer,
      /*uint256 startedAt*/
      ,
      /*uint256 updatedAt*/
      ,
      /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
    ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();
    return answer;
  }
}
```

The contract has the following components:

- The `import` line imports an interface named `AggregatorV3Interface`. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. In this case, `AggregatorV3Interface` defines that all v3 Aggregators have the function `latestRoundData`. You can [see the complete code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) for the `AggregatorV3Interface` on GitHub.

- The `constructor() {}` initializes an interface object named `dataFeed` that uses `AggregatorV3Interface` and connects specifically to a proxy aggregator contract that is already deployed at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`. The interface allows your contract to run functions on that deployed aggregator contract.

- The `getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer()` function calls your `dataFeed` object and runs the `latestRoundData()` function. When you deploy the contract, it initializes the `dataFeed` object to point to the aggregator at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`, which is the proxy address for the Sepolia BTC / USD data feed. Your contract connects to that address and executes the function. The aggregator connects with several oracle nodes and aggregates the pricing data from those nodes. The response from the aggregator includes several variables, but `getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer()` returns only the `answer` variable.

## Compile, deploy, and run the contract

> **CAUTION: Configure and fund your wallet**
>
> If you have not already configured your MetaMask wallet and funded it with testnet ETH, follow the instructions in [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) to set that up. You can get testnet ETH at one of the available [Sepolia faucets](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet).

Deploy the `DataConsumerV3` smart contract on the Sepolia testnet.

1. [Open the example contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataFeeds/DataConsumerV3.sol) in Remix. Remix opens and shows the contents of the smart contract.

   <div class="remix-callout">
     <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/DataFeeds/DataConsumerV3.sol">Open the contract in Remix</a>
   </div>

2. Because the code is already written, you can start the compile step. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings.

   (Image: Screenshot showing the Compiler tab and its settings.)

3. Use the default compiler settings. Click the **Compile DataConsumerV3.sol** button to compile the contract. Remix automatically detects the correct compiler version depending on the `pragma` that you specify in the contract. You can ignore warnings about unused local variables in this example.

   (Image: Screenshot of the Compile button.)

4. On the **Deploy** tab, select the **Injected Provider** environment. This contract specifically requires Web3 because it connects with another contract on the blockchain. Running in a JavaScript VM will not work.

   (Image: Screenshot showing the Injected Provider environment selected.)

5. Because the example contract has several imports, Remix might select another contract to deploy by default. In the **Contract** section, select the `DataConsumerV3` contract to make sure that Remix deploys the correct contract.

   (Image: Screenshot showing DataConsumerV3 as the contract to deploy.)

6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

   (Image: Screenshot of the Deploy button for DataConsumerV3.)

7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

   (Image: Screenshot showing Metamask asking you to confirm the transaction.)

8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

   (Image: Remix Deployed Contracts Section)

9. Click **getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer** to show the latest answer from the aggregator contract. In this example, the answer is the latest price, which appears just below the button. The returned answer is an integer, so it is missing its decimal point. You can find the correct number of decimal places for this answer on the [Price Feed addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) page by clicking the **Show more details** checkbox. The answer on the BTC / USD feed uses 8 decimal places, so an answer of `3030914000000` indicates a BTC / USD price of `30309.14`. Each feed uses a different number of decimal places for answers.

## Historical Data

# Getting Historical Data
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data


The most common use case for Data Feeds is to [Get the Latest Data](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) from a feed. However, the [AggregatorV3Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) also has functions to retrieve data of a previous round IDs.

There are two parameters that can cause Chainlink nodes to update:

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deviation Threshold | Chainlink nodes are monitoring data offchain. The deviation of the real-world data beyond a certain interval triggers all the nodes to update. |
| Heartbeat Threshold | If the data values stay within the deviation parameters, it will only trigger an update every *X* minutes / hours.                             |

You can find these parameters at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/) on an example like [ETH / USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd).

To learn how data feeds update, see the [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model?parent=dataFeeds#aggregator) page.

## Historical rounds

As shown in the [decentralized model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model), the consumer contracts call the proxy contract, which abstracts the underlying aggregator contract. The main advantage is to enable upgrades of the aggregator without impacting the consumer contracts. That also means that historical data can can be stored in different aggregators.

As shown in the following sequence diagram, to get historical data, call the `getRoundData` [function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata) and provide `roundId` as a parameter.

(Image: Image)

Note that roundIds have different meanings in proxy contracts and in aggregator contracts.

### `roundId` in Aggregator (aggregatorRoundId)

Oracles provide periodic data updates to the aggregators. Data feeds are updated in **rounds**. Rounds are identified by their `roundId`, which increases with each new round. This increase may not be monotonic. Knowing the `roundId` of a previous round allows contracts to consume historical data.

The examples in this document name the aggregator `roundId` as `aggregatorRoundId` to differentiate it from the proxy `roundId`.

### `roundId` in proxy

Because a proxy has references to current and all previous underlying aggregators, it needs a way to fetch data from the correct aggregator. The `roundId` is computed in the [proxy contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/AggregatorProxy.sol) as shown in the following example:

```solidity
return uint80(uint256(_phase) << PHASE_OFFSET | _originalId);
```

where:

- `_phase` is incremented each time the underlying aggregator implementation is updated. It is used as a key to find the aggregator address.
- `_originalId` is the aggregator `roundId`. The ID starts at 1.

From the above formula, you can think of it as returning a large number containing the `phase` and the aggregator `roundId`.

> **NOTE: Note**
>
> The example formula above ensures that no matter how many times the underlying aggregator changes, the proxy `roundId`
> will always increase.

**Example:**

When you query historical data, it is important to know when you reach the end of the history of the underlying aggregator. As an example, if the [`latestRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#latestrounddata) of the [LINK / USD Price Feed on Ethereum Mainnet](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum) returns `roundId = 92233720368547771158`, you can use this value to compute the `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`:

- `phaseId = 92233720368547771158 >> 64`: Right shifting an integer by 64 bits is equivalent to dividing it by 2^64: `phaseId = 92233720368547771158/ 2^64 = 5`. The current phase id is 5 , which means that this proxy has had 5 underlying aggregators since its initial deployment.
- `aggregatorRoundId = uint64(92233720368547771158)`: This retrieves the first 64 bits from the right. To calculate this offchain, you can use the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
// First parse to BigInt to perform computation with big integers
const num = BigInt("92233720368547771158")
const num2 = BigInt("0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF") // Largest 64bits integer

console.log(Number(num >> 64n)) // returns 5 (phaseId)
console.log(Number(num & num2)) // returns 13078 (aggregatorRoundId) . Use & (AND bitwise operator) which sets each bit to _1_ if both bits are _1_
```

Using *13078* as the current aggregator's round, get its historical data by looping over the [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata):

- Start from the first round: *92233720368547758081* (result of *92233720368547771158 - 13078 + 1*)
- Continue until the current round: *92233720368547771158*

To get the historical data for previous aggregators, decrement the `phaseId` and start from round *1*. For phase *4*, get the starting `roundId` offchain using the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
const phaseId = BigInt("4")
const aggregatorRoundId = BigInt("1")

roundId = (phaseId << 64n) | aggregatorRoundId // returns 73786976294838206465n
```

Loop over the [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata). Start at *73786976294838206465* and increment it until you get a revert. This means that you reached the last round for the underlying aggregator. The same process could be repeated for previous `phaseIds` (3,2,1).

> **CAUTION: Looping onchain**
>
> The examples showed how to loop offchain to fetch all historical data from a given proxy. You could also write a
> similar code onchain, but be aware that this could cause **very high gas prices** if a state is changed within the
> same function.

### `getRoundData` return values

The [`getRoundData` function](/data-feeds/api-reference/#getrounddata) returns the following values:

- `roundId`: The round in which the answer was updated
- `answer`: The answer reflects the data recorded for the specified round
- `answeredInRound`: <Icon type="deprecated" /> Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed
- `startedAt`: The timestamp when the round started
- `updatedAt`: The timestamp when the answer was computed

## L2 Sequencer Feeds

# L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds


Optimistic rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism) and many ZK-rollups rely on sequencers to efficiently manage transaction ordering, execution, and batching before submitting them to Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum. The sequencer plays a crucial role in optimizing transaction throughput, reducing fees, and ensuring fast transaction confirmations on L2 networks, making it a key component of their scalability and performance.

However, if the sequencer becomes unavailable, users will lose access to the standard read/write APIs, preventing them from interacting with applications on the L2 network. Although the L2 chain's security and state commitments remain enforced by Layer 1, no new batched blocks will be produced by the sequencer. Users with sufficient technical expertise can still interact directly with the network through the underlying rollup contracts on L1. However, this process is more complex and costly, creating an unfair advantage for those who can bypass the sequencer. This imbalance in access can lead to disruptions or distortions in applications, such as liquidations or market operations that rely on timely transactions.

To mitigate these risks, your applications can integrate a **Sequencer Uptime Data Feed**, which continuously monitors and records the last known status of the sequencer. By utilizing this feed, you can:

- Detect sequencer downtime in real time.
- Implement a grace period to prevent mass liquidations or unexpected disruptions.
- Ensure fair access to services by temporarily pausing operations during sequencer failures.

This proactive approach enhances the resilience and fairness of applications operating on L2 networks, ensuring a more stable and equitable user experience.

## Real-time Monitoring Process

### Arbitrum

The diagram below shows how these feeds update and how a consumer retrieves the status of the Arbitrum sequencer.

(Image: Image)

1. Chainlink nodes trigger an OCR round every 30s and update the sequencer status by calling the `validate` function in the [`ArbitrumValidator` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/l2ep/dev/arbitrum/ArbitrumValidator.sol) by calling it through the [`ValidatorProxy` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ValidatorProxy.sol).
2. The `ArbitrumValidator` checks to see if the latest update is different from the previous update. If it detects a difference, it places a message in the [Arbitrum inbox contract](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro).
3. The inbox contract sends the message to the [`ArbitrumSequencerUptimeFeed` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/l2ep/dev/arbitrum/ArbitrumSequencerUptimeFeed.sol). The message calls the `updateStatus` function in the `ArbitrumSequencerUptimeFeed` contract and updates the latest sequencer status to 0 if the sequencer is up and 1 if it is down. It also records the block timestamp to indicate when the message was sent from the L1 network.
4. A consumer contract on the L2 network can read these values from the [`ArbitrumUptimeFeedProxy` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/EACAggregatorProxy.sol), which reads values from the `ArbitrumSequencerUptimeFeed` contract.

#### Handling Arbitrum Outages

If the Arbitrum network becomes unavailable, the `ArbitrumValidator` contract continues to send messages to the L2 network through the delayed inbox on L1. This message stays there until the sequencer is back up again. When the sequencer comes back online after downtime, it processes all transactions from the delayed inbox before it accepts new transactions. The message that signals when the sequencer is down will be processed before any new messages with transactions that require the sequencer to be operational.

### Other Supported Networks

On BASE, Celo, Mantle, Metis, OP, Scroll, Soneium and zkSync, the sequencer's status is relayed from L1 to L2 where the consumer can retrieve it.

(Image: Image)

**On the L1 network:**

1. A network of node operators runs the external adapter to post the latest sequencer status to the `AggregatorProxy` contract and relays the status to the `Aggregator` contract. The `Aggregator` contract calls the `validate` function in the `OptimismValidator` contract.

2. The `OptimismValidator` contract calls the `sendMessage` function in the `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract. This message contains instructions to call the `updateStatus(bool status, uint64 timestamp)` function in the sequencer uptime feed deployed on the L2 network.

3. The `L1CrossDomainMessenger` contract calls the `enqueue` function to enqueue a new message to the `CanonicalTransactionChain`.

4. The `Sequencer` processes the transaction enqueued in the `CanonicalTransactionChain` contract to send it to the L2 contract.

**On the L2 network:**

1. The `Sequencer` posts the message to the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` contract.

2. The `L2CrossDomainMessenger` contract relays the message to the `OptimismSequencerUptimeFeed` contract.

3. The message relayed by the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` contains instructions to call `updateStatus` in the `OptimismSequencerUptimeFeed` contract.

4. Consumers can then read from the `AggregatorProxy` contract, which fetches the latest round data from the `OptimismSequencerUptimeFeed` contract.

#### Handling Other Supported Network Outages

If the sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2 and **no L2 transactions are executed**. Instead, messages are enqueued in the `CanonicalTransactionChain` on L1 and only processed in the order they arrived later when the sequencer comes back up. As long as the message from the validator on L1 is already enqueued in the `CTC`, the flag on the sequencer uptime feed on L2 will be guaranteed to be flipped prior to any subsequent transactions. The transaction that flips the flag on the uptime feed will be executed before transactions that were enqueued after it. This is further explained in the diagrams below.

When the Sequencer is down, all L2 transactions sent from the L1 network wait in the pending queue.

1. **Transaction 3** contains Chainlink’s transaction to set the status of the sequencer as being down on L2.
2. **Transaction 4** is a transaction made by a consumer that is dependent on the sequencer status.

(Image: Image)

After the sequencer comes back up, it moves all transactions in the pending queue to the processed queue.

1. Transactions are processed in the order they arrived so **Transaction 3** is processed before **Transaction 4**.
2. Because **Transaction 3** happens before **Transaction 4**, **Transaction 4** will read the status of the Sequencer as being down and responds accordingly.

(Image: Image)

## Example Consumer Contract

This example code works on any network that supports Solidity. Create the consumer contract for sequencer uptime feeds similarly to the contracts that you use for other [Chainlink Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds). Configure the constructor using the following variables:

- Configure the `sequencerUptimeFeed` object with the [sequencer uptime feed proxy address](#supported-networks) for your L2 network.
- Configure the `dataFeed` object with one of the [Data Feed proxy addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) that are available for your network.

    ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();

    return data;
  }
}
```

The `sequencerUptimeFeed` object returns the following values:

- `answer`: A variable with a value of either `0` or `1`
  - 0: The sequencer is up
  - 1: The sequencer is down
- `startedAt`: This timestamp indicates when the sequencer feed changed status. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract `startedAt` from `block.timestamp` and revert the request if the result is less than the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME`.
  - The `startedAt` variable returns `0` only on Arbitrum when the Sequencer Uptime contract is not yet initialized. For L2 chains other than Arbitrum, `startedAt` is set to `block.timestamp` on construction and `startedAt` is never `0`. After the feed begins rounds, the `startedAt` timestamp will always indicate when the sequencer feed last changed status.

If the sequencer is up and the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` has passed, the function retrieves the latest answer from the data feed using the `dataFeed` object.

# Price Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds


Chainlink Data Feeds provide data that is aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent node operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model?parent=dataFeeds) describes this in detail. However, there are some exceptions where data for a feed can come only from a single data source or where data values are calculated. Read the [Selecting Quality Data Feeds](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds) to learn about the different data feed categories and how to identify them.

## Rates Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/rates-feeds

# Rate and Volatility Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/rates-feeds


Chainlink rate and volatility feeds provide data for interest rates, interest rate curves, and asset volatility. You can read these feeds the same way that you read other Data Feeds. Specify the [Rate or Volatility Feed Address](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) that you want to read instead of specifying a Price Feed address. See the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) page to learn more.

The following data types are available:

- [Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve](#bitcoin-interest-rate-curve)
- [ETH Staking APR](#eth-staking-apr)
- [Realized Volatility](#realized-volatility)

## Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve

Lenders and borrowers use base rates to evaluate interest rate risk for lending and borrowing contracts, asset valuation for derivatives contracts, and an underlying rate for interest rate swap contracts. Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve Data Feeds provide a base rate to assist with market decisions and quantify the risks of using certain protocols and products based on current and predicted baseline interest rates. The curve’s normalized methodology and daily rates introduce more consistency and predictability to the ebb and flow of digital asset markets. Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve Feeds incorporate a wide range of data sources such as OTC lending desks, DeFi lending pools, and perpetual futures markets.

To learn more about the use of these interest rate curves in the industry, read the [Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve (CF BIRC)](https://blog.chain.link/cf-bitcoin-interest-rate-curve-cf-birc/) blog post.

See the [Rate and Volatility Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page to find the Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve feeds that are currently available.

## ETH Staking APR

The ETH Staking APR feeds provide a trust-minimized and tamper-proof source of truth for the global rate of return from staking as a validator to secure the Ethereum network. The annualized rate of return is calculated over 30-day and 90-day rolling windows. Data providers use offchain computation to calculate returns at an epoch level, reach consensus on the APR, and then write the results onchain to be used by decentralized protocols and Web 3 applications. Feeds are currently configured to update at a minimum of once per day.

See the [Rate and Volatility Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page to find the ETH Staking APR feeds that are currently available. If you have questions or would like to request an enhancement to ETH Staking APR feeds, contact us using [this form](https://forms.gle/Jc1MGY5ry1ceYH1X6).

## Realized volatility

Realized volatility measures asset price movement over a specific time interval. This value is expressed as a percent of the asset price. The more an asset price moves up or down over time, the higher the realized volatility is for that asset. Please note that realized volatility is not the same as implied volatility, which measures the market’s expectation about future volatility typically derived from options markets.

Each data feed reflects the volatility of an asset over a specific rolling window of time. For example, some data feeds provide volatility data for the last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days of time. You can compare the data across these windows to infer whether the volatility of an asset is trending up or down. For example, if realized volatility for the 24-hour window is higher than the 7-day window, volatility might increase.

The same high-quality data providers used in Chainlink’s price feeds sample price data every 10 minutes to refresh volatility estimates. onchain values are updated when the feed heartbeat or deviation threshold is met.

## Selecting Data Feeds

# Selecting Quality Data Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds


When you design your applications, consider the quality of the data that you use in your smart contracts. Ultimately you are responsible for identifying and assessing the accuracy, availability, and quality of data that you choose to consume via the Chainlink Network. Note that all feeds contain some inherent risk. Read the [Risk Mitigation](#risk-mitigation) and [Evaluating Data Sources](#evaluating-data-sources-and-risks) sections when making design decisions. Chainlink lists decentralized data feeds in the documentation to help developers build new applications integrated with data.

For a summary of data sourcing models by asset type, see [Data Sources](/data-feeds/data-sources).

## Data Feed Categories

This categorization is put in place to inform users about the intended use cases of feeds and help highlight some of the inherent market integrity risks surrounding the data quality of these feeds.

All feeds published on [docs.chain.link](http://docs.chain.link) are monitored and maintained to the same levels and standards. Each feed goes through a rigorous assessment process when implemented. The assessment criteria can vary depending on the product type of feed being deployed or change over time as the understanding of market integrity risks evolves.

Market price feeds incorporate three layers of aggregation at the data source, node operator, and oracle network layers, providing industry-standard security and reliability on the price data they reference. To learn more about the three layers of data aggregation, see the blog post about [Data Aggregation in Chainlink Price Feeds](https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-feeds/). Additional information about how Chainlink Data Feeds are secured can be seen in the blog post about [How Chainlink Price Feeds Secure the DeFi Ecosystem](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-price-feeds-secure-defi/).

Data feeds are grouped into the following categories based on the level of market integrity risk from lowest to highest:

- [🟢 Low Market Risk](#-low-market-risk-feeds)
- [🟡 Medium Market Risk](#-medium-market-risk-feeds)
- [🟠 High Market Risk](#-high-market-risk-feeds)
- [🔴 Very High Market Risk](#-very-high-market-risk-feeds)
- [🆕 New Token Feeds](#-new-token-feeds)
- [🔵 Custom Feeds](#-custom-feeds)
- [⭕ Deprecating](#-deprecating)

### 🟢 Low Market Risk Feeds

These are data feeds that follow a standardized data feeds workflow to report market prices for an asset pair. Chainlink node operators each query several sources for the market price and aggregate the estimates provided by those sources.

Low Market Risk feeds have the following characteristics:

- Highly resilient to disruption
- Leverage many data sources
- High volumes across a large number of markets enable consistent price discovery

While market risk may be low, other risks might still exist based on your use case, the blockchain on which the feed is deployed, and the conditions on that chain.

### 🟡 Medium Market Risk Feeds

These feeds also follow a standardized data feeds workflow to report market prices for an asset pair. The pair in question may have features that make it more challenging to reliably price, or potentially subject it to volatility which may pose a risk in some use cases. While the architecture of these feeds is resilient and distributed, these feeds carry additional market risk.

Types of market risk that may lead to a feed being categorized as Medium Market Risk include:

- Lower or inconsistent asset volume may result in periods of low liquidity in the market for such assets. This, in turn, can lead to volatile price movements.
- A spread between the price for this asset on different trading venues or liquidity pools.
- Market Concentration Risk: If the volume for a given asset is excessively concentrated on a single exchange, that trading venue could become a single point of failure for the feed.
- Cross-Rate Risk: The base asset trades in large volumes against assets that are not pegged to the quote asset. As a result, the price of this specific asset pair may fluctuate even if the underlying asset is not being traded.
- The asset is going through a significant market event such as a token or liquidity migration.
- The asset has a high spread between data providers, the root cause of which is often one of the above factors.

### 🟠 High Market Risk Feeds

These feeds also follow a standardized data feeds workflow to report market prices for an asset pair. However, the pair in question often exhibits a heightened degree of some of the risk factors outlined under Medium Market Risk, or a separate risk that makes the market price subject to uncertainty or volatility. In using a High Market Risk data feed you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with such a feed and that you are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating such risks. Developers remain responsible for ensuring that protocol risk parameters are configured appropriately and that the operation and performance of High Market Risk data feeds matches expectations. High Market Risk data feeds may be deprecated. See the [Data Feed Shutdown Policy](#data-feed-shutdown-policy) for more information.

### 🔴 Very High Market Risk Feeds

Very High Market Risk feeds price assets with quotes that are subject to extreme levels of risk, greater than those outlined above for High Market Risk. Types of market risk that may lead to a feed being categorized as Very High Market Risk include, but are not limited to:

- The asset is going through a significant market event such as a hack, bridge failure, or a delisting from a major exchange.
- The asset or project is being deprecated in the market.
- Volumes have dropped to extremely low levels.

Users should wind down their reliance on these feeds and/or implement strict capital and risk management policies accounting for extreme price and market structure volatility. Very High Market Risk feeds will be wound down over time in accordance with the [Data Feed Shutdown Policy](#data-feed-shutdown-policy). In using a Very High Market Risk data feed you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with such a feed and that you are solely responsible for monitoring and mitigating such risks. You understand that Chainlink may not provide separate monitoring for these feeds. Developers remain responsible for ensuring that protocol risk parameters are configured appropriately and that the operation and performance of Very High Market Risk data feeds matches expectations.

### 🆕 New Token Feeds

When a token is newly launched, the historical data required to implement a rigorous risk assessment framework that would allow the categorization of a market data feed for that token as Low, Medium, or High Market Risk is unavailable. Consistent price discovery may involve an indeterminate amount of time. Users must understand the additional [market and volatility risks](#evaluating-data-sources-and-risks) inherent with such assets. Users of New Token feeds are responsible for independently verifying the liquidity and stability of the assets priced by the feeds that they use. At the end of a probationary period, the status of New Token feeds may be adjusted to High, Medium, or Low Market Risk, or in rare cases be deprecated entirely.

### 🔵 Custom Feeds

Custom Feeds are built to serve a specific use case and might not be suitable for general use or your use case's risk parameters. Users must evaluate the properties of a feed to make sure it aligns with their intended use case. [Contact the Chainlink Labs team](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed) if you want more detail on any specific feeds in this category.

Custom Feeds have the following categories and compositions:

- **Onchain Single Source Feeds:** These feeds take their data from an onchain source, however, the feed has only a single data provider currently supporting the feed.
- **Onchain Proof of Reserve Feeds:** Chainlink Proof of Reserve uses a large decentralized collection of security-reviewed and Sybil-resistant node operators to acquire and verify reserve data. In this use case, reserves reside onchain.
- **Exchange Rate Feeds:** These feeds read an exchange rate from an external contract onchain that is designed to allow conversion from one token to another. Chainlink does not own or control these contracts in any way. They are not equivalent to market price feeds.
- **Technical Feeds:** Feeds within this category measure a particular technical metric from a specified blockchain. For example, Fast Gas or Block Difficulty.
- **Total Value Locked Feeds:** These feeds measure the total value locked in a particular protocol.
- **Custom Index Feeds:** An index calculates a function of the values for multiple underlying assets. The function is specific to that index and is typically calculated by node operators following an agreed formula.
- **Offchain Single Source Feeds:** Some data providers use a single data source, which might be necessary if only one source exists offchain for a specific type of data.
- **Offchain Proof of Reserve Feeds:** Chainlink Proof of Reserve uses a large decentralized collection of security-reviewed and Sybil-resistant node operators to acquire and verify reserve data. In this use case, reserves reside offchain.
- **LP Token Feeds:** These feeds use a decentralized feed for the underlying asset as well as calculations to value the liquidity pool (LP) tokens.
- **Wrapped Calculated Feeds:** These feeds are typically pegged 1:1 to the underlying token or asset. Under normal market conditions, these feeds track their underlying value accurately. However, given that the price is a derivative formed from a calculated method, the derivative asset may not always precisely track the value of the underlying token or asset.

If you plan on using one of these feeds and would like to get a more detailed understanding, [contact the Chainlink Labs team](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed).

### ⭕ Deprecating

These feeds are being deprecated. To find the deprecation dates for specific feeds, see the [Feeds Scheduled For Deprecation](/data-feeds/deprecating-feeds) page.

#### Data Feed Shutdown Policy

Data feeds managed by Chainlink Labs will be considered for deprecation if they pose a risk to the Chainlink Community and broader ecosystem, if the asset or assets (or their volume or liquidity) on the feed have significantly deteriorated or are unreliable and no longer meet our Quality Assurance standards, or if the data feed has become economically unsustainable to support. Users are therefore advised to ensure they have measures in place for the orderly deprecation of reliance on specific Chainlink price feeds.

Known users of these feeds will be contacted directly about the feeds' deprecation whenever possible. Notifications will also be posted on the [Feeds Scheduled For Deprecation](/data-feeds/deprecating-feeds) page and on our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/592041321326182401/991444378335838318) with two weeks of notice before they are shut down except where conditions require an accelerated deprecation.

> **NOTE: Data Feed Shutdown Behavior**
>
> Once a feed is shutdown, calls to the feed will behave as follows:

- `lastAnswer` will return `0`
- `latestRoundData` will revert with no data available

## Market hours

In addition to categories, be aware that markets for several assets are actively traded only during certain hours. Listed data feeds include an attribute describing their market hours. Chainlink Labs recommends using these feeds only during their specified hours:

| Feed                            | Hours                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Many non-G12 currencies primarily trade during local market hours. It is recommended to use those feeds only during local trading hours. We generally observe normal trading within these hours. Prices outside of these hours may be subject to volatility and users are advised to implement additional controls. In addition, local holidays, natural disasters, political unrest or other exogenous shocks are liable to interrupt normal trading in less-liquid currencies. |

## Risk Mitigation

As a development best practice, design your systems and smart contracts to be resilient and mitigate risk to your protocol and your users. Ensure that your systems can tolerate known and unknown exceptions that might occur. Some examples include but are not limited to volatile market conditions, the degraded performance of infrastructure, chains, or networks, and any other upstream outage related to data providers or node operators. You bear responsibility for any manner in which you use the Chainlink Network, its software, and documentation.

To help you prepare for unforeseen market events, you should take additional steps to protect your application or protocol regardless of the market risk categorization of the Data Feeds your application consumes. The below tooling is put in place to mitigate extreme market events, possible malicious activity on third-party venues or contracts, potential delays, performance degradation, and outages.
Below are some examples of tooling that Chainlink users have put in place:

- **Circuit breakers:** In the case of an extreme price event, the contract would pause operations for a limited period of time. [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation) is able to monitor data feeds to identify unexpected events. If an event were to occur, the Automation network can send an onchain transaction to pause or halt contract functionality.
- **Contract update delays:** Contracts would not update until the protocol had received a recent fresh input from the data feed.
- **Manual kill switch:** If a vulnerability or bug is discovered in one of the upstream contracts, the user can manually cease operation and temporarily sever the connection to the data feed.
- **Monitoring:** Some users create their own monitoring alerts based on deviations in the data feeds that they are using.
- **Soak testing:** Users are strongly advised to thoroughly test price feed integrations and incorporate a [soak period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soak_testing) prior to providing access to end users or securing value.

For more detailed information about some of these examples, see the [Monitoring data feeds](/data-feeds/#monitoring-data-feeds) documentation.

For important updates regarding the use of Chainlink Price Feeds, users should join the official Chainlink Discord and subscribe to the [data-feeds-user-notifications channel](https://discord.gg/Dqy5N9UbsR).

## Chainlink Community Deployments

Chainlink technology is used by many within the blockchain community to support their use cases. Deployments built and run by community members are not tracked in the Chainlink documentation. Chainlink's community is continuously growing, and they play a vital role in developing the ecosystem, so the software and tooling are developed for anyone to use. Users have a wide variety of options for choosing how to deliver data onchain. They can deploy Chainlink nodes themselves or via the extensive network of node operators that offer services and access one of the community-managed oracle networks that support the supply of various types of data onchain. Chainlink Labs does not take responsibility for the use of Chainlink node software.

It is always recommended that you conduct a thorough analysis of your requirements and carry out appropriate due diligence on any partners you wish to use with your project.

The Chainlink Labs team does not monitor community deployments and users should use best practices in observability, monitoring, and risk mitigation as appropriate for your application's stage of development and use case.

As your usage of data feeds evolves and requirements for higher availability and greater security increases, such as securing substantive value, the reliability properties of your data feed will become crucial. [Contact Chainlink Labs team](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed) for services to ensure deployments meet the highest levels of availability and security.

**High Risk: Forked, modified, or custom software:**

As Chainlink is open source, independent forks and modifications may exist. Chainlink Labs and development teams are not involved in these and do not track or maintain visibility on them. Chainlink Labs is not responsible for updates, enhancements, or bug fixes for these versions, and Chainlink Labs does not monitor them. Their use might pose risks that can do harm to your project. Users are responsible for thoroughly vetting and validating such deployments and determining their suitability.

## Evaluating Data Sources and Risks

If your smart contracts use data feeds, assess those data feeds for the following characteristics. For a summary of data sourcing models by asset type, see [Data Sources](/data-feeds/data-sources).

- [Liquidity and its Distribution](#liquidity-and-its-distribution)
- [Single Source Data Providers](#single-source-data-providers)
- [Crypto and Blockchain Actions](#crypto-and-blockchain-actions)
- [Market Failures Resulting from Extreme Events](#market-failures-resulting-from-extreme-events)
- [Periods of High Network Congestion](#periods-of-high-network-congestion)
- [Unknown and Known Users](#unknown-and-known-users)
- [DEX volumes](#dex-volumes)

### Liquidity and its Distribution

If your smart contract relies on pricing data for a specific asset, make sure that the asset has a sufficiently healthy level of liquidity in the market to avoid price and market manipulation. Assets with low liquidity or volume can be volatile, which might negatively impact your application and its users. Malicious actors might try to exploit volatility or periods of reduced trading activity to take advantage of the logic in a smart contract and cause it to execute in a way that you did not intend.

Some data feeds obtain their pricing data from individual exchanges rather than from aggregated price tracking services that gather their data from multiple exchanges. These are marked as such in the docs page for that feed. Assess the liquidity and reliability of that specific exchange.

Liquidity migrations occur when a project moves its tokens from one liquidity provider (such as a DEX, a CEX, or a new DeFi application) to another. When liquidity migrations occur, it can result in low liquidity in the original pool, making the asset susceptible to market manipulation. If your project is considering a liquidity migration, you should coordinate with relevant stakeholders, including liquidity providers, exchanges, oracle node operators, Data Feed providers, and users, to ensure prices are accurately reported throughout the migration.

Feeds for assets with low market liquidity or volume where data providers exhibit an abnormal price spread may, on occasion, see a price oscillate between two or more price points within regular intervals. To mitigate risk associated with such price oscillation, users must regularly monitor & assess the quality of an asset's liquidity. Similarly, assets with low market liquidity may experience abnormal or volatile price movements due to erroneous trades.

Design and test your contracts to handle price spikes and implement risk management measures to protect your assets. For example, create mock tests that return various oracle responses.

### Single Source Data Providers

Some data providers use a single data source, which might be necessary if only one source exists onchain or offchain for a specific type of data. Evaluate data providers to make sure they provide high-quality data that your smart contracts can rely on. Any error or omission in the provider's data might negatively impact your application and its users.

### Crypto and Blockchain Actions

Price data quality is subject to crypto actions by the crypto and blockchain project teams. Crypto actions are similar to [corporate actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_action) but are specific to cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, such as token renaming, token swaps, redenominations, splits, reverse splits, network upgrades, and other migrations that teams or communities who govern the blockchain or token might undertake.

Sustaining data quality is dependent on data sources implementing the necessary adjustments related to such actions. For example, when a project upgrades to a new version of their token, this results in a token migration. When token migrations occur, they require building a new Data Feed to ensure that the token price is accurately reported. Similarly, actions by blockchain project teams or communities, such as forks or upgrades to the network, may require new Data Feeds to ensure continuity and data quality. When considering a token migration, fork, network upgrade, or other crypto action, projects should proactively reach out to relevant stakeholders to ensure the asset price is accurately reported throughout the process.

### Market Failures Resulting from Extreme Events

Users are strongly advised to set up monitoring and alerts in the event of unexpected market failures. Black swan events, hacks, coordinated attacks, or extreme market conditions may trigger unanticipated outcomes such as liquidity pools becoming unbalanced, unexpected re-weighting of indices, abnormal behavior by centralized or decentralized exchanges, or the de-pegging of synthetic assets, stablecoins, and currencies from their intended exchange rates.

Circuit breakers can be created using [Chainlink Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation). Circuit breakers are safety measures that monitor data feeds for unexpected scenarios such as stale prices, drastic price changes, or prices approaching a predetermined min/max threshold. If an unexpected scenario occurs, the circuit breaker can send an onchain transaction to pause or halt contract functionality.

### Periods of High Network Congestion

Data Feed performance relies on the chains they are deployed on. Periods of high network congestion or network downtime might impact the frequency of Chainlink Data Feeds. It is advised that you configure your applications to detect such chain performance or reliability issues and to respond appropriately.

### Unknown and Known Users

Routine maintenance is carried out on Chainlink Data Feeds, including decommissioning, on an ad-hoc basis. These maintenance periods might require users to take action in order to maintain business continuity.

Notifications are sent to inform known users regarding such occurrences, and it is strongly encouraged for all users, including those users utilizing data feeds for offchain purposes, [to provide their contact information](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed) before utilizing data feeds. Without providing contact information, users will be unable to receive notifications regarding important Data Feed updates.

If you are using Data Feeds but have not provided your contact information, you can do so [here](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed). Users that fail to provide notification information do so at their own risk.

### DEX Volumes

Assets with a significant market presence on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) face distinct risks related to unique market structure. The market integrity can be compromised by flash loan-funded attacks, volume shifts to different onchain or offchain exchanges, or a well-capitalized actor temporarily manipulating the price on that exchange. Additionally, DEX trades can result in slippage due to liquidity migrations and trade size. The likelihood of high-slippage trades being accurately reflected in market prices depends on the trading patterns of the asset.

Generally, a lower risk of deviant trades impacting aggregated prices is associated with assets having multiple DEX pools with healthy volumes and consistent trading activity across different time windows.

When assessing a Chainlink Data Feed for a wrapped or bridged asset such as WBTC, users should evaluate the tradeoffs between using a Data Feed specifically built for the wrapped or bridged asset or a Data Feed built for the underlying asset.

Decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis considering the liquidity, depth, and trading volatility of the underlying asset compared to its derivative. In addition, users must consider the security mechanism that is designed to keep the wrapped or bridged asset coupled to its underlying asset. Review these parameters regularly as asset dynamics continuously evolve.

### Extreme Events Causing Price Deviations in Wrapped or Bridged Assets

Chainlink Data Feeds are designed to provide the market-wide price of various assets, as determined by a volume-weighted average across a wide range of exchanges. On blockchain networks where assets are wrapped and/or bridged from another environment using a cross-chain token bridge, Chainlink Data Feeds built for the underlying asset will continue to report the market-wide price of the underlying asset as opposed to the price of the wrapped/bridged asset. This methodology reduces risks around market manipulation because wrapped/bridged tokens are often less liquid than the underlying asset.

However, users should be aware that certain extreme events may result in price deviations between the wrapped/bridged asset and its underlying counterpart. For example, the exploitation or hack of a cross-chain token bridge may cause a collapse in demand for a particular wrapped asset. As such, users should construct their applications with safeguards, such as circuit breakers to proactively pause functionality to mitigate risk during such scenarios. Circuit breakers can be created using Chainlink Automation to monitor data feeds for unexpected scenarios.

An additional mechanism for securing a protocol utilizing wrapped assets is by incorporating [Chainlink Proof of Reserve](https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve). Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables the real-time reserve monitoring of offchain and cross-chain assets, including those that have been wrapped/bridged. By comparing the wrapped token’s supply against a Chainlink Proof of Reserve feed, protocols can ensure that these assets are properly collateralized at all times.

### Front Running Risk

Front running (when a third party benefits from prior access to information about a transaction) is a known risk inherent to specific blockchain applications. Chainlink Data Feeds are optimized to prioritize high levels of data quality and reliability over latency.

To mitigate the risk associated with front running, users building highly latency-dependent applications should assess whether the configuration of data feeds meets their needed specifications for speed and frequency. [Chainlink Data Streams](https://docs.chain.link/data-streams) serve as an alternative solution to Data Feeds for latency-sensitive applications, providing low-latency delivery of market data offchain that can be verified onchain while mitigating front running.

## Exchange Rate Feeds

The architecture of exchange rate feeds differs from that of standard market rate Chainlink Price Feeds.

**Market rate feeds** (e.g., Chainlink Price Feeds) deliver price updates based on the volume-based aggregated market price of a specific asset. Price data is [aggregated from across multiple sources](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-price-feeds-secure-defi/), including centralized and decentralized exchanges, to provide an accurate representation of an asset's market-wide price.

**Exchange rate feeds** are tied to specific protocols or ecosystems and report the internal redemption rates for an asset (i.e., the value/rate at which an asset can be redeemed or exchanged within that protocol's ecosystem). This data is sourced directly from a specified smart contract on a source chain and relayed to a destination chain.

Exchange rate feeds are useful in circumstances such as:

- **Pricing yield-bearing assets:** Multiplying a yield-bearing asset's exchange rate by the underlying asset's market rate can be used to calculate the yield-bearing asset's current price. This methodology can reduce certain pricing volatility risks associated with lower-liquidity yield-bearing assets.
- **Enabling cross-chain staking:** For example, liquid staking tokens (LSTs) or liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) can be minted at the exchange rate on a layer 2, while Chainlink CCIP transfers the underlying asset to a layer 1 for staking.
- **Improving liquidity pool performance for yield-bearing assets:** Exchange rate feeds can be utilized to programmatically adjust swap curves to maximize liquidity efficiency.

> **NOTE**
>
> Users must be aware that both market rate and exchange rate pricing methodologies have unique risk considerations and
> mitigation strategies that vary based on an asset's type and liquidity profile. Users are responsible for decisions
> relating to feed selection. To learn more about how best to leverage Chainlink Data Feeds for your project, contact us

## ETF and Forex feeds

When you use Data Feeds for ETFs or Foreign Exchange (Forex) data, be aware of the following best practices:

- Offchain equity and ETF assets are traded only during [standard market hours](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#market-hours). Do not use these feeds outside those windows.
- Assets on the Forex (Foreign Exchange) markets are traded only during [defined market hours](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#market-hours). Additionally, some currencies might trade only during local banking hours. Do not use Forex feeds outside market hours for the specific currency.
- UK ETF price feed answers are 15 minutes delayed from their original published source. Assets are traded only during [standard market hours](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds#market-hours). Do not use these feeds outside their specified hours.

# SmartData
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/smartdata


Chainlink SmartData is a suite of onchain data offerings designed to unlock the utility, accessibility, and reliability of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). By providing secure minting assurances alongside essential real-world data such as reserves, Net Asset Value (NAV), and Assets Under Management (AUM) data, the SmartData suite embeds security and enriches data into tokenized RWA offerings.

## SmartData Feed Types

SmartData offers two distinct types of data feeds:

1. **Single-value SmartData Feeds**: Similar to traditional price feeds, these provide a single numeric value per feed (like total reserves or NAV). These use the [`AggregatorV3Interface`](/data-feeds/api-reference#aggregatorv3interface) and are read the same way as other Data Feeds.

2. **[Multiple-Variable Response (MVR) Feeds](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds)**: These bundle multiple data points of various types (both numeric and non-numeric) into a single onchain update. MVR feeds use the [`BundleAggregatorProxy` interface](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds/api-reference#ibundleaggregatorproxy) and require a different approach to read and decode the data.

## SmartData Product Categories

- [Proof of Reserve Feeds](#proof-of-reserve-feeds)
- [NAVLink Feeds](#navlink-feeds)
- [SmartAUM Feeds](#smartaum-feeds)

### Proof of Reserve Feeds

Proof of Reserves feeds provide the status of reserves for stablecoins, wrapped assets, and real world assets. Proof of Reserve Feeds operate similarly to Price Feeds, but provide answers in units of measurement such as ounces (oz) or number of tokens.

To find a list of available Proof of Reserve Feeds, see the [SmartData Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page.

#### Types of Proof of Reserve Feeds

Reserves are available for both offchain assets and cross-chain assets. This categorization describes the data reporting variations of Proof of Reserve feeds and helps highlight some of the inherent market risks surrounding the data quality of these feeds.

##### Offchain reserves

Offchain reserves are sourced from APIs through an [external adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).

(Image: Image)

Offchain reserves provide their data using the following methods:

- Third-party: An auditor, accounting firm, or other third party audits and verifies reserves. This is done by combining both fiat and investment assets into a numeric value that is reported against the token.
- Custodian: Reserves data are pulled directly from the bank or custodian. The custodian has direct access to the bank or vault holding the assets. Generally, this works when the underlying asset pulled requires no additional valuation and is simply reported onchain.
- ⚠️ Self-reported: Reserve data is read from an API that the token issuer hosts. Reserve data reported by an asset issuer's self-hosted API carries additional risks. Chainlink Labs is not responsible for the accuracy of self-reported reserves data. Users must do their own risk assessment for asset issuer risk.

##### Cross-chain reserves

Cross-chain reserves are sourced from the network where the reserves are held. Chainlink node operators can report cross-chain reserves by running an [external adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) and querying the source-chain client directly. In some instances, the reserves are composed of a dynamic list of IDs or addresses using a composite adapter.

(Image: Image)

Cross-chain reserves provide their data using the following methods:

- Wallet address manager: The project uses the [IPoRAddressList](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/PoRAddressList.sol) wallet address manager contract and self-reports which addresses they own. Reserve data reported by an asset issuer's self-reported addresses carries additional risks. Chainlink Labs is not responsible for the accuracy of self-reported reserves data. Users must do their own risk assessment for asset issuer risk.
- Wallet address: The project reports which addresses they own through a self-hosted API. Reserve data reported by an asset issuer's self-reported addresses carries additional risks. Chainlink Labs is not responsible for the accuracy of self-reported reserves data. Users must do their own risk assessment for asset issuer risk.

> \*\*CAUTION: Disclaimer\*\*
>
>
>
> <p>
>   Proof of Reserve feeds can vary in their configurations. Please be careful with the configuration of the feeds used
>   by your smart contracts. You are solely responsible for reviewing the quality of the data (e.g., a Proof of Reserve
>   feed) that you integrate into your smart contracts and assume full responsibility for any damage, injury, or any
>   other loss caused by your use of the feeds used by your smart contracts.
> </p>

### NAVLink Feeds

Chainlink NAVLink Feeds provide real-time, tamper-proof data on the Net Asset Value (NAV) of tokenized assets, funds, or portfolios. NAV is an essential metric in the financial industry for assessing the value of mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles. It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets held within the vehicle.

By making NAV data available onchain, developers can build decentralized applications that require accurate and up-to-date valuation metrics. These applications include asset management platforms, DeFi protocols, and investment strategies that rely on NAV for operations such as rebalancing, minting, or redemption.

To find a list of available SmartNav Feeds, see the [SmartData Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page.

### SmartAUM Feeds

Chainlink SmartAUM Feeds provide current data on the total market value of assets managed by an entity on behalf of clients. Assets Under Management (AUM) is a crucial indicator used in financial analyses and decision-making processes.

By bringing AUM data onchain, decentralized applications can access information for activities such as risk assessment, performance benchmarking, and investment strategy development.

To find a list of available Assets Under Management Feeds, see the [SmartData Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) page.

## Using SmartData Feeds

### Using Single-value SmartData Feeds

Read answers from single-value SmartData feeds the same way that you read other Data Feeds. Specify the [SmartData feed address](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses) that you want to read instead of specifying a Price feed address. See the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) page to learn more.

Using Solidity, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

Example for reading a Proof of Reserve feed:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.24;

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract ReserveConsumerV3 {
  AggregatorV3Interface internal reserveFeed;

  /**
   * Network: Ethereum Mainnet
   * Aggregator: WBTC PoR
   * Address: 0xa81FE04086865e63E12dD3776978E49DEEa2ea4e
   */
  constructor() {
    reserveFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0xa81FE04086865e63E12dD3776978E49DEEa2ea4e);
  }

  /**
   * Returns the latest price
   */
  function getLatestReserve() public view returns (int256) {
    // prettier-ignore
    (
      /*uint80 roundID*/
      ,
      int256 reserve,
      /*uint startedAt*/
      ,
      /*uint timeStamp*/
      ,
      /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
    ) = reserveFeed.latestRoundData();

    return reserve;
  }
}
```

### Using MVR Feeds

[MVR feeds](/data-feeds/mvr-feeds) require a different approach compared to single-value SmartData feeds. Instead of returning a single numeric value, they return a bytes array that must be decoded into a specific data structure.

Your code needs to:

1. Call the `latestBundle()` function to get the raw data
2. Decode the bytes array into a struct that matches the feed's structure
3. Apply the appropriate decimal scaling to numeric fields

For detailed implementation guides, see:

# Data Feeds on Solana
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/solana


Chainlink provides data feeds on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network. Chainlink data feeds on Solana employ [Offchain Reporting (OCR)](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting?parent=dataFeeds) to aggregate data from data providers who pull from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Chainlink’s Solana deployment has no dependencies on external blockchain networks such as Ethereum. In Solana, storage and smart contract logic are separate. Programs store all the logic similar to an EVM (Ethereum) smart contract. The accounts store all the data. Compared to Solidity, the combination of an account and a program is equivalent to a smart contract on an EVM chain. State and logic are separate in Solana.

Solana programs are stateless, so you don't always need to deploy your program to the network to test it. You can deploy and test your programs on a [Solana Test Validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator). However, to use Chainlink products on Solana, you must deploy your contract onchain to one of the [supported Solana clusters](#chainlink-products-and-solana-clusters).

> **NOTE: Note**
>
> Please note that Price Feeds performance relies on the chains they are deployed on. Periods of high network congestion
> may impact the frequency of Chainlink Price Feeds. Subscribe to [Solana status](https://status.solana.com/)
> notifications to stay updated on system performance.

To learn how to mitigate risk to your applications, read the [Selecting Quality Data Feeds](/data-feeds/selecting-data-feeds) page.

## Chainlink products and Solana clusters

[Price Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=solana) are available on the following Solana clusters:

- [Solana Mainnet](https://solscan.io/)
- [Solana Devnet](https://solscan.io/?cluster=devnet)

Solana provides a [Testnet cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters#testnet) that runs newer [Solana releases](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases), but Chainlink Data Feeds are not available on this cluster.

See the [Solana Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=solana) page for a full list of Chainlink data feeds that are available on Solana.

To learn when more Chainlink services become available, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainlink) or sign up for our [mailing list](/resources/developer-communications?parent=dataFeeds).

## Languages, tools, and frameworks

The examples in the Chainlink documentation use the following languages, tools, and frameworks:

- [Node.js 14 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Used to run client code
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): A general-purpose programming language designed for performance and memory safety
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/): A [Solana Sealevel Framework](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor) that provides several developer tools
- [Chainlink Solana Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit): An Anchor based program and client that shows developers how to use and interact with Chainlink Data Feeds on Solana
- [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli): The Solana command line interface
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): Used to clone the example code repository

When developing applications to use Chainlink products on Solana, always use a [Mainnet release](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) version of the Solana CLI that is equal to or greater than the version currently running on your target cluster. Use `solana --version` and `solana cluster-version` to check CLI and cluster versions:

```shell
solana --version
solana-cli 1.9.28 (src:b576e9cc; feat:320703611)

solana cluster-version --url devnet
1.9.25

solana cluster-version --url mainnet-beta
1.9.28
```

The examples in this documentation use Solana programs in [Rust](https://solana.com/docs/programs/rust). To learn more about the Solana programming model, see the [Solana Documentation](https://solana.com/docs/core).

## Solana wallets

When you use Chainlink on Solana, you need a [Solana wallet](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/). The Chainlink documentation uses [file system wallets](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide/file-system-wallet) and free Devnet SOL tokens to demonstrate examples. When you deploy your programs to the Solana Mainnet, you must use wallets with mainnet lamports.

If you have existing wallets that you want to use for the guides in the Chainlink documentation, find your wallet keypair and make it available in your development environment as a file. You can point [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com) and the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli) to a specific keypair when you deploy or manage your Solana programs.

```shell
anchor build
⋮

anchor deploy --provider.wallet ~/.config/solana/id.json --provider.cluster devnet
⋮

solana program show --programs --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json --url devnet

Program Id                                   | Slot      | Authority                                    | Balance
6U4suTp55kiJRKqV7HGAQvFgcLaStLnUA4myg5DRqsKw | 109609728 | E6gKKToCJPgf4zEL1GRLL6T99g2WcfAzJAMvtma1KijT | 2.57751768 SOL
```

When you build your production applications and deploy Solana programs to the Mainnet cluster, always follow the security best practices in the [Solana Wallet Guide](https://docs.solana.com/wallet-guide) for managing your wallets and keypairs.

## Using Data Feeds
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/using-data-feeds

# Using Data Feeds on EVM Chains
Source: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/using-data-feeds


The code for reading Data Feeds is the same across all EVM-compatible blockchains and Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for different uses, but the request and response format are the same. To read a feed, specify the following variables:

- **RPC endpoint URL:** This determines which network that your smart contracts will run on. You can use a [node provider service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) or point to your own [client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/). If you are using a Web3 wallet, it is already configured with the RPC endpoints for several networks and the [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) will automatically detect them for you.
- **LINK token contract address:** The address for the LINK token contract is different for each network. You can find the full list of addresses for all supported networks on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=dataFeeds) page.
- **Feed contract address:** This determines which data feed your smart contract will read. Contract addresses are different for each network. You can find the available contract addresses on the following pages:
  - [Price Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses)
  - [SmartData Addresses](/data-feeds/smartdata/addresses)

The examples in this document indicate these variables, but you can modify the examples to work on different networks and read different feeds.

This guide shows example code that reads data feeds using the following languages:

- Onchain consumer contracts:
  - [Solidity](#solidity)
  - [Vyper](#vyper)
- Offchain reads using Web3 packages:
  - [Javascript](#javascript) with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Python](#python) with [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - [Golang](#golang) with [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

## Reading data feeds onchain

These code examples demonstrate how to deploy a consumer contract onchain that reads a data feed and stores the value.

### Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import {AggregatorV3Interface} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES HARDCODED
 * VALUES FOR CLARITY.
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */

/**
 * If you are reading data feeds on L2 networks, you must
 * check the latest answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime
 * Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event
 * of an L2 sequencer outage. See the
 * https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds
 * page for details.
 */
contract DataConsumerV3 {
  AggregatorV3Interface internal dataFeed;

  /**
   * Network: Sepolia
   * Aggregator: BTC/USD
   * Address: 0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
   */
  constructor() {
    dataFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43);
  }

  /**
   * Returns the latest answer.
   */
  function getChainlinkDataFeedLatestAnswer() public view returns (int256) {
    // prettier-ignore
    (
      /* uint80 roundId */
      ,
      int256 answer,
      /*uint256 startedAt*/
      ,
      /*uint256 updatedAt*/
      ,
      /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
    ) = dataFeed.latestRoundData();
    return answer;
  }
}
```

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference) for more details.

### Vyper

To consume price data, your smart contract should import `AggregatorV3Interface` which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds. You can find it [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.vy).
You can find a `PriceConsumer` example [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/PriceConsumer.vy). Read the ***apeworx-starter-kit*** [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit) to learn how to run the example.

## Reading data feeds offchain

These code examples demonstrate how to read data feeds directly off chain using Web3 packages for each language.

### Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.

<LatestPrice client:idle feedAddress={priceFeedAddresses.btc.usd.sepolia.address} supportedChain="ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA" />

### Python

This example uses [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.

```py
# THIS IS EXAMPLE CODE THAT USES HARDCODED VALUES FOR CLARITY.
# THIS IS EXAMPLE CODE THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
# DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.

from web3 import Web3

# Change this to use your own RPC URL
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia'))
# AggregatorV3Interface ABI
abi = '[{"inputs":[],"name":"decimals","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"","type":"uint8"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"description","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint80","name":"_roundId","type":"uint80"}],"name":"getRoundData","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint80","name":"roundId","type":"uint80"},{"internalType":"int256","name":"answer","type":"int256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"startedAt","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"updatedAt","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint80","name":"answeredInRound","type":"uint80"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"latestRoundData","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint80","name":"roundId","type":"uint80"},{"internalType":"int256","name":"answer","type":"int256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"startedAt","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"updatedAt","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint80","name":"answeredInRound","type":"uint80"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"version","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]'
# Price Feed address
addr = '0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43'

# Set up contract instance
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=addr, abi=abi)
# Make call to latestRoundData()
latestData = contract.functions.latestRoundData().call()
print(latestData)
```

### Golang

You can find an example with all the source files [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/pricefeed-golang). This example uses [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) to retrieve feed data from the [BTC / USD feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43) on the Sepolia testnet.
To learn how to run the example, see the [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/pricefeed-golang/README.md).

## Getting a different price denomination

Chainlink Data Feeds can be used in combination to derive denominated price pairs in other currencies.

If you require a denomination other than what is provided, you can use two data feeds to derive the pair that you need. For example, if you needed a BTC / EUR price, you could take the BTC / USD feed and the EUR / USD feed and derive BTC / EUR using division.

# Chainlink Data Streams

<DataStreams section="dsNotes" />

Chainlink Data Streams delivers low-latency market data offchain, which you can verify onchain. This approach provides decentralized applications (dApps) with on-demand access to high-frequency market data backed by decentralized, fault-tolerant, and transparent infrastructure.

Traditional push-based oracles update onchain data at set intervals or when certain price thresholds are met. In contrast, Chainlink Data Streams uses a pull-based design that preserves trust-minimization with onchain verification.

Data Streams are offered in [several report formats](/data-streams/reference/report-schema-overview), each designed for distinct asset classes.

See data sourcing details in the [Data Sources](/data-streams/data-sources) page.

## Sub-Second Data and Commit-and-Reveal

Chainlink Data Streams supports sub-second data resolution for latency-sensitive use cases by retrieving data only when needed. You can combine the data with any transaction in near real time. A "commit-and-reveal" approach mitigates frontrunning by making trade data and stream data visible atomically onchain.

## Comparison to push-based oracles

Chainlink's push-based oracles regularly publish price data onchain. By contrast, Chainlink Data Streams relies on a pull-based design, letting you retrieve a report and verify it onchain whenever you need it. Verification confirms that the decentralized oracle network (DON) agreed on and signed the data. Some applications only need onchain data at fixed intervals, which suits push-based oracles. However, others require higher-frequency updates and lower latency. Pull-based oracles meet these needs and still provide cryptographic guarantees about data accuracy.

(Image: Image)

Pull-based oracles also operate more efficiently by retrieving data only when necessary. For example, a decentralized exchange might fetch a Data Streams report and verify it onchain only when a user executes a trade, rather than continuously pushing updates that might not be immediately used.

## Comprehensive market insights

Chainlink Data Streams offers price points such as mid prices and [Liquidity-Weighted Bid and Ask](/data-streams/concepts/liquidity-weighted-prices) (LWBA) for Crypto Streams. LWBA prices reflect current order book conditions, providing deeper insight into market liquidity and depth. With additional parameters, such as volatility and liquidity metrics, Data Streams helps protocols enhance trading accuracy, improve onchain risk management, and dynamically adjust margins or settlement conditions in response to real-time market shifts.

## High availability and resilient infrastructure

Data Streams API services use an [active-active multi-site deployment](/data-streams/architecture#active-active-multi-site-deployment) model across multiple distributed and isolated origins. This architecture ensures continuous operations even if one origin fails, delivering robust fault tolerance and high availability.

For real-time streaming applications, the SDKs support **High Availability (HA) mode** that establishes multiple simultaneous connections for zero-downtime operation. When enabled, HA mode provides:

- **Automatic failover** between connections
- **Report deduplication** across connections
- **Automatic origin discovery** to find available endpoints
- **Per-connection monitoring** and statistics

**Learn more:** [Go SDK](/data-streams/reference/data-streams-api/go-sdk#high-availability-ha-mode) | [Rust SDK](/data-streams/reference/data-streams-api/rust-sdk#high-availability-mode) | [TypeScript SDK](/data-streams/reference/data-streams-api/ts-sdk#high-availability-mode)

## Example use cases

Access to low-latency, high-frequency data enables a variety of onchain applications:

- **Perpetual Futures:** Sub-second data and frontrunning mitigation allow onchain perpetual futures protocols to compete with centralized exchanges on performance while retaining transparency and decentralization.
- **Options:** Pull-based oracles provide timely settlement of options contracts with the added benefit of market liquidity data to support dynamic onchain risk management.
- **Prediction Markets:** High-frequency updates let participants act on real-time data, ensuring quick reactions to events and accurate settlement.

## Key capabilities

- **Sub-second Latency:** Pull data on-demand with minimal delay
- **Cryptographic Verification:** Verify data authenticity onchain when needed
- **Multiple Access Methods:** REST API, WebSocket, or SDK integration
- **Comprehensive Market Data:** Mid prices, LWBA prices, volatility, and liquidity metrics
- **High Availability:** Multi-site deployment ensures 99.9%+ uptime

## How to use Data Streams

You can access Chainlink Data Streams through SDKs and APIs, allowing you to build custom solutions with low-latency, high-frequency data. Fetch reports or subscribe to report updates from the Data Streams Aggregation Network and verify their authenticity onchain.

> **CAUTION: Upgrade Time-Based Upkeep Recommended**
>
> The Automation “Time-based” upkeep contract has been updated so that only the unique forwarder for your upkeep can call it. If your upkeep was deployed before 11 December 2025, we recommend you replace your existing “Time-based” upkeeps using the new “Time-based” upkeep.

To upgrade, simply follow the [Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/) to register a new “Time-based” upkeep with the same details as your previous upkeep. Once registered, you can delete the previous upkeep.

Upgrading to the latest “Time-based” upkeep removes i) the ability of 3rd parties to trigger your upkeep, and ii) the possibility that a call with insufficient gas ticks the Timer forward but fails to execute your desired function.

Automate your smart contracts using a secure and hyper-reliable decentralized network that uses the same external network of node operators that secures billions in value. Building on Chainlink Automation will accelerate your innovation, save you time and money, and help you get to market faster so you don't have to deal with the setup cost, ongoing maintenance, and risks associated with a centralized automation stack.

# Automation Billing and Costs
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/overview/automation-economics


## Cost of using Chainlink Automation

Chainlink Automation requires only an execution fee for transactions onchain. This fee includes the transaction cost, a node operator percentage fee, and a small fixed gas overhead accounting for gas between the network and the registry.
The percentage fee compensates the Automation Network for monitoring and performing your upkeep. The Automation percentage fee varies by chain and is listed on our [Supported Networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page.

The fee calculation for upkeeps that are configured for LINK payments (or other non-native payments as applicable) have a conversion from native tokens to LINK (or other non-native payments as applicable).
This conversion is not performed in the fee calculation for upkeeps that are configured for native token payments. Otherwise, the fee formula is the same for both payment types:

<TabsContent sharedStore="paymentMethod" client:visible>
  <Fragment slot="tab.1">LINK</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Native tokens</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    **Formula for Registry v2.3**

    Fee<sub>LINK</sub> = \[tx.gasPrice<sub>Native WEI</sub> \* gasUsed \* (1 + premium%) + (gasOverhead \* tx.gasPrice<sub>Native WEI</sub>)]/\[LINK/Native<sub>Rate in WEI</sub>]
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    **Formula for Registry v2.3**

    Fee<sub>Native</sub> = tx.gasPrice<sub>Native WEI</sub> \* gasUsed \* (1 + premium%) + (gasOverhead \* tx.gasPrice<sub>Native WEI</sub>)
  </Fragment>
</TabsContent>

There is no registration fee or other fees for any offchain computation.

> **NOTE: Additional fees for specific cases**
>
> On Automation v2.3 and earlier, there is an additional flat per-transaction fee of 0.01 LINK in the following cases:

- For testnet transactions on all supported networks to account for node infrastructure costs.

### Fee calculation example

An upkeep transaction was [performed](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x19309782e15952c90dcadcc02cbf34f331daaeee369d3e3acca43bade02af105) on *Polygon mainnet*. It used *110,051* gas at a gas price of *182,723,799,380 wei*.
The node operator percentage on Polygon was *70%* at the time of this transaction, and this fee [varies by network](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

The tables below show how the fees are calculated for upkeeps configured for LINK payments:

The LINK/MATIC exchange rate for this transaction was *7,308,290,731,273,610,000 wei*. The upkeep's LINK balance was reduced by a fee of *0.008077 LINK*. The preceding information and calculation can be found in the table below:

| Variable                          | Description                                                                                                                       | Value                     |

0.008077 = \[182,723,799,380 \* (110,051 + 80,000) \* (1 + 70%)]/\[7,308,290,731,273,610,000]

## How funding works

Upkeeps have a LINK (ERC-677) balance. Every time an onchain transaction is performed for your upkeep, its LINK balance will be reduced by the LINK fee.

Your upkeep's balance must exceed the [minimum balance](#minimum-balance). If this requirement is not met, the Automation Network will not perform onchain transactions. You can add funds using the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/) or by directly calling the `addFunds()` function on the `AutomationRegistry` contract. Anyone can call the `addFunds()` function.

## Withdrawing funds

To withdraw a LINK balance, you must cancel your upkeep first. Any upkeep that has not spent more than an aggregated amount of 0.1 LINK fees over the span of its lifetime is subject to a *0.1 LINK* fee. This cancellation fee protects node operators from spammers who register jobs that never perform.

**Example 1**: Your upkeep has spent *4.8 LINK* over its lifetime and has a balance of *5 LINK*. When it is cancelled, I will receive *5 LINK*.
**Example 2**: Your upkeep has spent *0 LINK* over its lifetime and has a balance of *5 LINK*. When it is cancelled, I will receive *4.9 LINK*.

## No node competition

Individual Automation Nodes do not compete with one another, but rather work together to ensure all registered upkeeps are performed. This makes costs more predictable upfront, enabling you to estimate costs based on the expected gas consumption.

## Minimum balance

The Chainlink Automation Network is designed to perform your upkeep even when gas prices spike. The minimum balance in LINK reflects the best estimate of the cost to perform your upkeep when gas prices spike. To ensure your upkeep is monitored and performed, ensure that your upkeep's balance is above this minimum balance.

The minimum balance is calculated using the current fast gas price, the gas limit you entered for your upkeep, the max gas multiplier, and the LINK/Native<sub>Rate in WEI</sub> for conversion to LINK. To find the latest value for the `gasCeilingMultiplier`, see the [Registry Configuration](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks) page.

Follow [maintain a minimum balance](/chainlink-automation/guides/manage-upkeeps/#maintain-a-minimum-balance) to ensure that your upkeep is funded.

## Price selection and gas bumping

Automation Nodes select the gas price dynamically based on the prices of transactions within the last several blocks. This optimizes the gas price based on current network conditions. Automation Nodes are configured to select a price based on a target percentile.

If the Automation Node does not see the `performUpkeep` transaction get confirmed within the next few blocks, it automatically replaces the transaction and bumps the gas price. This process repeats until the transaction is confirmed.

## ERC-677 LINK

For funding on mainnet, you will need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you ERC-20 LINK tokens. Use PegSwap to [convert Chainlink tokens (LINK) to be ERC-677 compatible](https://pegswap.chain.link/). Use [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to get testnet LINK.

# Create Automation-Compatible Contracts
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/guides/compatible-contracts


<ChainlinkAutomation callout="cre" />

Learn how to make smart contracts that are compatible with `Automation`.

> **TIP: Considerations and Best Practices**
>
> Before you deploy contracts to use with Chainlink Automation, read the [Best Practices](/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice) guide. These best practices are important for using Chainlink Automation securely and reliably. You can also read more about the Chainlink Automation architecture [here](/chainlink-automation/concepts/automation-architecture).

## Automation compatible contracts

A contract is Automation-compatible when it follows a specified interface that allows the Chainlink Automation Network to determine if, when, and how the contract should be automated.

The interface you use will depend on the type of trigger you want to use:

- If you want a log event to trigger your upkeep, use the [`ILogAutomation`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces/#ilogautomation) interface.
- If you want to use onchain state in a custom calculation to trigger your upkeep, use [`AutomationCompatibleInterface`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces/#automationcompatibleinterface) interface.
- If you want to call a function just based on time, you don't need an interface. Consider instead using a [time-based upkeep](/chainlink-automation/guides/job-scheduler).
- If you want to use Automation with Data Streams, use [`StreamsLookupCompatibleInterface`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces/#streamslookupcompatibleinterface) interface.

You can learn more about these interfaces [here](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces).

## Example Automation-compatible contract using custom logic trigger

Custom logic Automation compatible contracts must meet the following requirements:

- Import `AutomationCompatible.sol`. You can refer to the [Chainlink Contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src) on GitHub to find the latest version.
- Use the [`AutomationCompatibleInterface`](/chainlink-automation/reference/automation-interfaces) from the library to ensure your `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` function definitions match the definitions expected by the Chainlink Automation Network.
- Include a `checkUpkeep` function that contains the logic that will be executed offchain to see if `performUpkeep` should be executed. `checkUpkeep` can use onchain data and a specified `checkData` parameter to perform complex calculations offchain and then send the result to `performUpkeep` as `performData`.
- Include a `performUpkeep` function that will be executed onchain when `checkUpkeep` returns `true`.

Use these elements to create a compatible contract that will automatically increment a counter after every `updateInterval` seconds. After you register the contract as an upkeep, the Chainlink Automation Network frequently simulates your `checkUpkeep` offchain to determine if the `updateInterval` time has passed since the last increment (timestamp). When `checkUpkeep` returns true, the Chainlink Automation Network calls `performUpkeep` onchain and increments the counter. This cycle repeats until the upkeep is cancelled or runs out of funding.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

// AutomationCompatible.sol imports the functions from both ./AutomationBase.sol and
// ./interfaces/AutomationCompatibleInterface.sol

 */

/**

 */
contract Counter is AutomationCompatibleInterface {
  /**
   * Public counter variable
   */
  uint256 public counter;

  /**
   * Use an interval in seconds and a timestamp to slow execution of Upkeep
   */
  uint256 public immutable interval;
  uint256 public lastTimeStamp;

  constructor(
    uint256 updateInterval
  ) {
    interval = updateInterval;
    lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;

    counter = 0;
  }

  function checkUpkeep(
    bytes calldata /* checkData */
  )
    external
    view
    override
    returns (
      bool upkeepNeeded,
      bytes memory /* performData */
    )
  {
    upkeepNeeded = (block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) > interval;
    // We don't use the checkData in this example. The checkData is defined when the Upkeep was registered.
  }

  function performUpkeep(
    bytes calldata /* performData */
  ) external override {
    if ((block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) > interval) {
      lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
    // We don't use the performData in this example. The performData is generated by the Automation Node's call to your
    // checkUpkeep function
  }
}
```

Compile and deploy your own Automation Counter onto a [supported Testnet](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

1. In the Remix example, select the compile tab on the left and press the compile button. Make sure that your contract compiles without any errors. Note that the Warning messages in this example are acceptable and will not block the deployment.
2. Select the **Deploy** tab and deploy the `Counter` smart contract in the `injected web3` environment. When deploying the contract, specify the `updateInterval` value. For this example, set a short interval of 60. This is the interval at which the `performUpkeep` function will be called.
3. After deployment is complete, copy the address of the deployed contract. This address is required to register your upkeep in the [Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/). The example in this document uses [custom logic](/chainlink-automation/guides/register-upkeep) automation.

To see more complex examples, go to the [Quick Starts](/quickstarts/eth-balance-monitor) page.

Now register your [upkeep](/chainlink-automation/guides/register-upkeep).

## Vyper example

> **NOTE: Note on arrays**
>
> Make sure the checkdata array size is correct. Vyper does not support dynamic arrays.

You can find a `KeepersConsumer` example [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/KeepersConsumer.vy). Read the ***apeworx-starter-kit*** [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit) to learn how to run the example.

# Create a Time-Based Upkeep
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/guides/job-scheduler


Create powerful automation for your smart contract using time schedules without having to create Automation-compatible contracts. This guide explains how to register time-based upkeeps.

(Image: Job Scheduler animation)

> **TIP: Testing and best practices**
>
> Follow the [best practices](/chainlink-automation/concepts/best-practice) when creating an Automation-compatible
> contract and test your upkeep on a testnet before deploying it to a mainnet.

> **CAUTION: Upgrade Time-Based Upkeep Recommended**
>
> The Automation “Time-based” upkeep contract has been updated so that only the unique forwarder for your upkeep can call it. If your upkeep was deployed before 11 December 2025, we recommend you replace your existing “Time-based” upkeeps using the new “Time-based” upkeep.

To upgrade, simply follow the [Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/) to register a new “Time-based” upkeep with the same details as your previous upkeep. Once registered, you can delete the previous upkeep.

Upgrading to the latest “Time-based” upkeep removes i) the ability of 3rd parties to trigger your upkeep, and ii) the possibility that a call with insufficient gas ticks the Timer forward but fails to execute your desired function.

## Using the Chainlink Automation app

In the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link/), click the blue **Register new Upkeep** button.

(Image: Image)

### Connecting your wallet

If you do not already have a wallet connected with the Chainlink Automation network, the interface will prompt you to do so. Click the **Connect Wallet** button and follow the remaining prompts to connect your wallet to one of the [Automation supported blockchain networks](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

(Image: Image)

## Trigger selection

Select **Time-based** trigger.

(Image: Image)

## Using time-based triggers

When you select the time-based trigger, you are prompted to enter a *contract address*. Provide the address of the contract you want to automate. If you did not verify the contract on chain, you will need to paste the [Application Binary Interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) (ABI) of the deployed contract into the corresponding text box. Select the function name that you want to execute and provide any static inputs. If you want to use dynamic inputs please see [Custom logic Upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/guides/register-upkeep)

(Image: Image)

### Specifying the time schedule

After you have successfully entered your contract address and ABI, specify your time schedule in the form of a [CRON expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). CRON expressions provide a shorthand way of creating a time schedule. You can use the provided example buttons in the Automation app to experiment with different schedules. Then, create your own time schedule.

```
Cron jobs are interpreted according to this format:

  ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
  │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  │ │ │ │ │
  * * * * *

All times are in UTC.

- can be used for range e.g. "0 8-16 * * *"
/ can be used for interval e.g. "0 */2 * * *"
, can be used for list e.g. "0 17 * * 0,2,4"

Special limitations:
  * there is no year field
  * no special characters: ? L W #
  * lists can have a max length of 26
  * no words like JAN / FEB or MON / TUES
```

After entering your CRON expression, click **Next**.

(Image: Image)

## Entering upkeep details

Provide the following information in the Automation app:

- **Upkeep name**: This will be visible in the Chainlink Automation app.
- **Gas limit**: This is the maximum amount of gas that your transaction requires to execute on chain. This limit cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` value configured on the [registry](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks).

> **NOTE: Job Scheduler Gas requirements**
>
> When you create an upkeep through the Job Scheduler, Chainlink Automation deploys a new `CronUpkeep` contract from the
> [CronUpkeepFactory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/d5a253fb6959104844eda8479c08909a76a6fea7/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/upkeeps/CronUpkeepFactory.sol)
> to manage your time schedule and ensure that it is compatible. Because this contract uses roughly 110K gas per call, it is
> recommended to add 150K additional gas to the gas limit of the function you would like to automate.

- **Starting balance (LINK)**: Specify a LINK starting balance to fund your upkeep. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the correct contract address and access faucets for testnet LINK. This field is required. You must have LINK before you can use the Chainlink Automation service.

> **TIP: ERC-677 Link**
>
> For registration you must use ERC-677 LINK. Read our [LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to determine where
> to acquire mainnet LINK, or visit [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to request testnet LINK.

- **Your email address (optional)**: This email address will be used to send you an email notification when your upkeep is underfunded.

(Image: Image)

## Complete upkeep registration

Click **Register upkeep** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
(Image: Upkeep Registration Success Message)

Your upkeeps will be displayed in your list of **Active Upkeeps**. You must monitor the balance of your upkeep. If the balance drops below the **minimum balance**, the Chainlink Automation Network will not perform the Upkeep. See [Managing Upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/guides/manage-upkeeps) to learn how to manage your upkeeps.

## Functions Overview
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions

# Chainlink Functions
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions


<ChainlinkFunctions callout="cre" />

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts access to trust-minimized compute infrastructure, allowing you to fetch data from APIs and perform custom computation. Your smart contract sends source code in a request to a [Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts), and each node in the DON executes the code in a serverless environment. The DON then aggregates all the independent return values from each execution and sends the final result back to your smart contract.

Chainlink Functions eliminates the need for you to manage your own Chainlink node and provides decentralized offchain computation and consensus, ensuring that a minority of the network cannot manipulate the response sent back to your smart contract.

Furthermore, Chainlink Functions allows you to include secret values in your request that are encrypted using threshold encryption. These values can only be decrypted via a multi-party decryption process, meaning that every node can only decrypt the secrets with participation from other DON nodes. This feature can provide API keys or other sensitive values to your source code, enabling access to APIs that require authentication.

To pay for requests, you fund a subscription account with LINK. Your subscription is billed when the DON fulfills your requests. Check out the [subscriptions](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions) page for more information.

Read the [architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) page to learn more about how Chainlink Functions works.

See the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) page for simple tutorials showing you different GET and POST requests that run on Chainlink Functions. You can also gain hands-on experience with Chainlink Functions with the [Chainlink Functions Playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).

## When to use Chainlink Functions

> **NOTE**
>
> Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You are responsible for independently reviewing any code and API dependencies that you submit in a request. Community-created code examples might not be audited, so you must independently review this code before you use it.

Chainlink Functions is offered "as is" and "as available" without conditions or warranties of any kind. Neither Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs from Functions due to issues in your code or downstream issues with API dependencies. You must ensure that the data sources or APIs specified in requests are of sufficient quality and have the proper availability for your use case. Users are responsible for complying with the licensing agreements for all data providers that they connect with through Chainlink Functions. Violations of data provider licensing agreements or the [terms](https://chain.link/terms) can result in suspension or termination of your Chainlink Functions account or subscription.

Chainlink Functions enables a variety of use cases. Use Chainlink Functions to:

- Connect to any public data. For example, you can connect your smart contracts to weather statistics for parametric insurance or real-time sports results for Dynamic NFTs.
- Connect to public data and transform it before consumption. You could calculate Twitter sentiment after reading data from the Twitter API, or derive asset prices after reading price data from [Chainlink Price Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds).
- Connect to a password-protected data source; from IoT devices like smartwatches to enterprise resource planning systems.
- Connect to an external decentralized database, such as IPFS, to facilitate offchain processes for a dApp or build a low-cost governance voting system.
- Connect to your Web2 application and build complex hybrid smart contracts.
- Fetch data from almost any Web2 system such as AWS S3, Firebase, or Google Cloud Storage.

You can find several community examples at [useChainlinkFunctions.com](https://www.usechainlinkfunctions.com/)

## Supported networks

See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page to find a list of supported networks and contract addresses.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

## Getting Started with Functions
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/getting-started

# Getting Started
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/getting-started


<ChainlinkFunctions callout="cre" />

Learn how to make requests to the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) and make any computation or API calls offchain. Chainlink Functions is available on several blockchains (see the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks)), but this guide uses Sepolia to simplify access to testnet funds. Complete the following tasks to get started with Chainlink Functions:

- Set up your web3 wallet and fund it with testnet tokens.
- Simulate a Chainlink Functions on the [Chainlink Functions
  Playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).
- Send a Chainlink Functions request to the DON. The JavaScript source code makes an API call to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.info) and fetches the name of a given character.
- Receive the response from Chainlink Functions and parse the result.

## Simulation

Before making a Chainlink Functions request from your smart contract, it is always a good practice to simulate the source code offchain to make any adjustments or corrections.

1. Open the [Functions playground](https://functions.chain.link/playground).

2. Copy and paste the following source code into the playground's code block.

   ```js
   const characterId = args[0];
   const apiResponse = await Functions.makeHttpRequest({
     url: `https://swapi.info/api/people/${characterId}/`,
   });
   if (apiResponse.error) {
     throw Error("Request failed");
   }
   const { data } = apiResponse;
   return Functions.encodeString(data.name);
   ```

3. Under *Argument*, set the first argument to 1. You are going to fetch the name of the first Star Wars character.

4. Click on *Run code*. Under *Output*, you should see *Luke Skywalker*.

## Configure your resources

### Configure your wallet

You will test on Sepolia, so you must have an Ethereum web3 wallet with enough testnet ETH and LINK tokens. Testnet ETH is the native gas fee token on Sepolia. You will use testnet ETH tokens to pay for gas whenever you make a transaction on Sepolia. On the other hand, you will use LINK tokens to pay the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracles Network (DON) for processing your request.

1. [Install the MetaMask wallet](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) or other Ethereum web3 wallet.

2. Set the network for your wallet to the Sepolia testnet. If you need to add Sepolia to your wallet, you can find the chain ID and the LINK token contract address on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts#sepolia-testnet) page.
   -

3. Request testnet LINK and ETH from [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

### Deploy a Functions consumer contract on Sepolia

1. Open the [GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol) contract in Remix.

   [Open GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/GettingStartedFunctionsConsumer.sol)

2. Compile the contract.

3. Open MetaMask and select the *Sepolia* network.

4. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, select *Injected Provider - MetaMask* in the **Environment** list. Remix will use the MetaMask wallet to communicate with *Sepolia*.

   (Image: Image)

5. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction. Check the transaction details to make sure you are deploying the contract to *Sepolia*.

   (Image: Image)

6. After you confirm the transaction, the contract address appears in the **Deployed Contracts** list. Copy the contract address and save it for later. You will use this address with a Functions Subscription.

   (Image: Image)

### Create a subscription

You use a Chainlink Functions subscription to pay for, manage, and track Functions requests.

1. Go to [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/).

2. Click **Connect wallet**:

   (Image: Image)

3. Read and accept the Chainlink Foundation Terms of Service. Then click **MetaMask**.

   (Image: Image)

4. Make sure your wallet is connected to the *Sepolia* testnet. If not, click the network name in the top right corner of the page and select *Sepolia*.

   (Image: Image)

5. Click **Create Subscription**:

   (Image: Image)

6. Provide an email address and an optional subscription name:

   (Image: Image)

7. The first time you interact with the Subscription Manager using your EOA, you must accept the Terms of Service (ToS). A MetaMask popup appears and you are asked to accept the ToS:

   (Image: Image)

8. After you approve the ToS, another MetaMask popup appears, and you are asked to approve the subscription creation:

   (Image: Image)

9. After the subscription is created, MetaMask prompts you to sign a message that links the subscription name and email address to your subscription:

   (Image: Image)

   (Image: Image)

### Fund your subscription

1. After the subscription is created, the Functions UI prompts you to fund your subscription. Click **Add funds**:

   (Image: Image)

2. For this example, add 2 LINK and click **Add funds**:

## Run the example

The example is hardcoded to communicate with Chainlink Functions on Sepolia. After this example is run, you can examine the code and see a detailed description of all components.

1. In Remix under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, expand your contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

2. Expand the `sendRequest` function to display its parameters.

3. Fill in the `subscriptionId` with your subscription ID and `args` with `[1]`. You can find your subscription ID on the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager at [functions.chain.link](https://functions.chain.link/). The `[1]` value for `args` specifies which argument in the response will be retrieved.

4. Click the **transact** button.

   (Image: Image)

5. Wait for the request to be fulfilled. You can monitor the status of your request on the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.

   (Image: Image)

6. Refresh the Functions UI to get the latest request status.

7. After the status is *Success*, check the character name. In Remix, under the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab, click the `character` function. If the transaction and request ran correctly, you will see the name of your character in the response.

- To write a Chainlink Functions consumer contract, your contract must import [FunctionsClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol) and [FunctionsRequest.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/libraries/FunctionsRequest.sol). You can read the API references: [FunctionsClient](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client) and [FunctionsRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request).

  These contracts are available in an NPM package so that you can import them from within your project.

  ```
  import {FunctionsClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol";
  import {FunctionsRequest} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/libraries/FunctionsRequest.sol";
  ```

- Use the FunctionsRequest.sol library to get all the functions needed for building a Chainlink Functions request.

  ```
  using FunctionsRequest for FunctionsRequest.Request;
  ```

- The latest request ID, latest received response, and latest received error (if any) are defined as state variables:

  ```
  bytes32 public s_lastRequestId;
  bytes public s_lastResponse;
  bytes public s_lastError;
  ```

- We define the `Response` event that your smart contract will emit during the callback

  ```
  event Response(bytes32 indexed requestId, string character, bytes response, bytes err);
  ```

- The Chainlink Functions router address and donID are hardcoded for Sepolia. Check the [supported networks page](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) to try the code sample on another testnet.

- The `gasLimit` is hardcoded to `300000`, the amount of gas that Chainlink Functions will use to fulfill your request.

- The JavaScript source code is hardcoded in the `source` state variable. For more explanation, read the [JavaScript code section](#javascript-code).

- Pass the router address for your network when you deploy the contract:

  ```
  constructor() FunctionsClient(router)
  ```

- The two remaining functions are:
  - `sendRequest` for sending a request. It receives the subscription ID and list of arguments to pass to the source code. Then:
    - It uses the `FunctionsRequest` library to initialize the request and add the source code and arguments. You can read the API Reference for [Initializing a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#initializerequestforinlinejavascript) and [adding arguments](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#setargs).

      ```
      FunctionsRequest.Request memory req;
      req.initializeRequestForInlineJavaScript(source);
      if (args.length > 0) req.setArgs(args);
      ```

    - It sends the request to the router by calling the `FunctionsClient` `sendRequest` function. You can read the API reference for [sending a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#_sendrequest). Finally, it stores the request id in `s_lastRequestId` and returns it.

      ```
      s_lastRequestId = _sendRequest(
          req.encodeCBOR(),
          subscriptionId,
          gasLimit,
          jobId
      );
      return s_lastRequestId;
      ```

      **Note**: `_sendRequest` accepts requests encoded in `bytes`. Therefore, you must encode it using [encodeCBOR](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-request/#encodecbor).

- `fulfillRequest` to be invoked during the callback. This function is defined in `FunctionsClient` as `virtual` (read `fulfillRequest` [API reference](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#fulfillrequest)). So, your smart contract must override the function to implement the callback. The implementation of the callback is straightforward: the contract stores the latest response and error in `s_lastResponse` and `s_lastError`, parses the `response` from `bytes` to `string` to fetch the character name before emitting the `Response` event.

  ```
  s_lastResponse = response;
  character = string(response);
  s_lastError = err;
  emit Response(requestId, s_lastResponse, s_lastError);
  ```

### JavaScript code

```js
const characterId = args[0];
const apiResponse = await Functions.makeHttpRequest({
  url: `https://swapi.info/api/people/${characterId}/`,
});
if (apiResponse.error) {
  throw Error("Request failed");
}
const { data } = apiResponse;
return Functions.encodeString(data.name);
```

This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) to make HTTP requests. The source code calls the `https://swapi.info/` API to request a Star Wars character name. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) documentation and the [Star Wars API documentation](https://swapi.info/people), you notice that URL has the following format where `$characterId` is provided as parameter when making the HTTP request:

```
url: `https://swapi.info/api/people/${characterId}/`
```

To check the expected API response for the first character, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://swapi.info/api/people/1/` or run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://swapi.info/api/people/1/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "name": "Luke Skywalker",
  "height": "172",
  "mass": "77",
  "hair_color": "blond",
  "skin_color": "fair",
  "eye_color": "blue",
  "birth_year": "19BBY",
  "gender": "male",
  "homeworld": "https://swapi.info/api/planets/1/",
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/1/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/2/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/3/",
    "https://swapi.info/api/films/6/"
  ],
  "species": [],
  "vehicles": ["https://swapi.info/api/vehicles/14/", "https://swapi.info/api/vehicles/30/"],
  "starships": ["https://swapi.info/api/starships/12/", "https://swapi.info/api/starships/22/"],
  "created": "2014-12-09T13:50:51.644000Z",
  "edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:56.891000Z",
  "url": "https://swapi.info/api/people/1/"
}
```

Now that you understand the structure of the API. Let's delve into the JavaScript code. The main steps are:

- Fetch `characterId` from `args`. Args is an array. The `characterId` is located in the first element.
- Make the HTTP call using `Functions.makeHttpRequest` and store the response in `apiResponse`.
- Throw an error if the call is not successful.
- The API response is located at `data`.
- Read the name from the API response `data.name` and return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeString` helper function. Because the `name` is a `string`, we use `encodeString`. For other data types, you can use different [data encoding functions](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#data-encoding-functions).
  **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.

> page.

## Request and Receive Data

This model is similar to the [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model): The consumer contract initiates the cycle by sending a request to the [FunctionsRouter contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsRouter.sol). Oracle nodes watch for events emitted by the [FunctionsCoordinator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_1_0/FunctionsCoordinator.sol) and run the computation offchain. Finally, oracle nodes use the [Chainlink OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the returned before passing the single aggregated response back to the consumer contract via a callback function.

(Image: Image)

The main actors and components are:

- Initiator (or end-user): initiates the request to Chainlink Functions. It can be an [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or Chainlink Automation.
- Consumer contract: smart contract deployed by developers, which purpose is to interact with the FunctionsRouter to initiate a request.
- FunctionsRouter contract: manages subscriptions and is the entry point for consumers. The interface of the router is stable. Consumers call the `sendRequest` method to initiate a request.
- FunctionsCoordinator contracts: interface for the [Decentralized Oracle Network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#decentralized-oracles). Oracle nodes listen to events emitted by the coordinator contract and interact with the coordinator to transmit the responses.
- DON: Chainlink Functions are powered by a [Decentralized Oracle Network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#decentralized-oracles). The oracle nodes are independent of each other and are responsible for executing the request's source code. The nodes use the [Chainlink OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the nodes' responses. Finally, a DON's oracle sends the aggregate response to the consumer contract in a callback.
- Secrets endpoint: To transmit their secrets, users can encrypt them with the DON public key and then upload them to the secrets endpoint, a highly available service for securely sharing encrypted secrets with the nodes. **Note**: An alternative method involves self-hosting secrets. In this approach, users provide a publicly accessible HTTP(s) URL, allowing nodes to retrieve the encrypted secrets. Refer to the [secrets management](/chainlink-functions/resources/secrets) page for detailed information on both methods.
- Serverless Environment: Every Oracle node accesses a distinct, sandboxed environment for computation. While the diagram illustrates an API request, the computation isn't restricted solely to this. You can perform any computation, from API calls to mathematical operations, using vanilla [Deno](https://deno.land/) code without module imports. Note: All nodes execute identical computations. If the target API has throttling limits, know that multiple simultaneous calls will occur since each DON node will independently run the request's source code.

Let's walk through the sequence of interactions among these components, as illustrated in the diagram:

1. If there are secrets, a user encrypts secrets with the public key linked to the DON master secret key (MSK) and then uploads the encrypted secrets to the secrets endpoint. The secrets endpoint pushes the encrypted secrets to the nodes part of the DON (The secrets capability depicted in this diagram is called *threshold encryption* and is explained in [secrets management](/chainlink-functions/resources/secrets#threshold-encryption)).
2. An [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or Chainlink Automation initiates the request by calling the consumer contract.
3. The consumer contract should inherit the [FunctionsClient](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol) contract. This ensures it will be able to receive responses from the [FunctionsRouter](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsRouter.sol) contract via the `handleOracleFulfillment` callback. The router contract starts the billing to estimate the fulfillment costs and block the amount in the *reservation balance* (To learn more, read [Cost simulation](/chainlink-functions/resources/billing#cost-simulation-reservation)). Then it calls the [FunctionsCoordinator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_1_0/FunctionsCoordinator.sol).
4. The coordinator contract emits an `OracleRequest` event containing information about the request.
5. On reception of the event by the DON, the DON's nodes decrypt the secrets using threshold decryption (The threshold encryption feature is explained in [secrets management](/chainlink-functions/resources/secrets#threshold-encryption)). Each DON's Oracle node executes the request's source code in a serverless environment.
6. The DON runs the Offchain Reporting protocol (OCR) to aggregate the values returned by each node's execution of the source code.
7. A DON's oracle node transmits the attested report (which includes the aggregated response) to the FunctionsCoordinator contract.
8. The FunctionsCoordinator contract calls the FunctionsRouter's `fulfill` method to calculate the fulfillment costs and finalize the billing (To learn more, read [Cost calculation](/chainlink-functions/resources/billing#cost-calculation-fulfillment)).
9. The FunctionsRouter contract calls the consumer contract's callback with the aggregated response.

**Note**: Chainlink Functions requests are not limited to API requests. The diagram depicts an example of API requests, but you can request the DON to run any computation.

## Subscription management

Chainlink Functions do not require your consumer contracts to hold LINK tokens and send them to oracles when making requests. Instead, you must create a subscription account and fund it to pay for your Chainlink Functions requests, so your consumer contracts don't need to hold LINK when calling Chainlink Functions.

### Concepts

- Terms of service (ToS): Before interacting with Chainlink Functions, users must agree to the terms of service. Once signed, the accounts that can manage subscriptions are added to the `allowedSenders` in the [ToS allow list contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/accessControl/TermsOfServiceAllowList.sol).
- Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager: A user interface that allows users to agree to the sign Terms of service and interact with the FunctionsRouter to manage subscriptions.
- Subscription account: An account that holds LINK tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink DON. A *Subscription ID* uniquely identifies each account.
- Subscription ID: 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the *Subscription account*.
- Subscription owner: The wallet address that creates and manages a *Subscription account*. Any account can add LINK tokens to the subscription balance. Still, only the owner can add consumer contracts to the subscription, remove consumer contracts from the subscription, withdraw funds, or transfer a subscription. Only the subscription owner can generate encrypted secrets for requests that use their *Subscription ID*.
- Subscription balance: The amount of LINK maintained on your *Subscription account*. Requests from consumer contracts are funded as long as sufficient funds are in the balance, so be sure to maintain sufficient funds in your *Subscription balance* to pay for the requests and keep your applications running.
- Subscription reservation: The amount of LINK blocked on the *Subscription balance*. It corresponds to the total LINK amount to be paid by in-flight requests.
- Effective balance: The amount of LINK available on your *Subscription account*. `Effective balance = Subscription balance - Subscription reservation`.
- Subscription consumers: Consumer contracts are approved to use funding from your *Subscription account* while making Chainlink Functions requests. The consumers receive response data in a callback.

### Accept ToS

To ensure compliance and governance, Chainlink Functions mandates that any account that manages a subscription must first accept the platform's Terms of Service (ToS). The acceptance is verified by cross-referencing the account with the `allowedSenders` registry contained within the [TermsOfServiceAllowList contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/accessControl/TermsOfServiceAllowList.sol).

(Image: Image)

The acceptance process is initiated via the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager. After a user accepts the ToS by generating the required signature with their externally owned account (EOA), they transmit proof of acceptance to the [TermsOfServiceAllowList contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/accessControl/TermsOfServiceAllowList.sol). Upon successful validation of the proof, the EOA is added to the `allowedSenders` registry, permitting it to manage subscriptions.

### Create subscription

(Image: Image)

After the ToS is accepted, EOAs can create subscriptions. Upon creation, the [FunctionsRouter](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/FunctionsRouter.sol) assigns a unique identifier, *Subscription ID*.

**Note**: EOAs can directly interact with the FunctionsRouter contract using their preferred web3 library, such as web3.js or ethers.js.

### Fund subscription

(Image: Image)

You must fund your subscription accounts with enough LINK tokens:

1. Connect your EOA to the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.
2. Fund your subscription account. The Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager abstracts the following:
   1. Call `transferAndCall` on the LINK token contract, transferring LINK tokens along with the *Subscription ID* in the payload.
   2. The FunctionsRouter contract implements `onTokenTransfer`: It parses the *Subscription ID* from the payload and funds the subscription account with the transferred LINK amount.

**Note**: EOAs can directly interact with the LinkToken contract using their preferred web3 library, such as web3.js or ethers.js.

### Add consumer

(Image: Image)

You must allowlist your consumers' contracts on your subscription account before they can make Chainlink Functions requests:

1. Connect your EOA to the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.
2. Add the address of the consumer contract to the subscription account.
3. The Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager interacts with the FunctionsRouter contract to register the consumer contract address to the subscription account.

**Note**: EOAs can directly interact with the FunctionsRouter contract using a web3 library, such as web3.js or ethers.js.

### Remove consumer

(Image: Image)

To prevent further Chainlink Functions requests from a given consumer contract, you must remove it from your subscription account:

1. Connect your EOA to the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.
2. Remove the address of the consumer contract from the subscription account.
3. The Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager communicates with the FunctionsRouter contract to remove the consumer contract address from the subscription account.

**Note**: You can still remove consumers from your subscription even if in-flight requests exist. The consumer contract will still receive a callback, and your *Subscription Account* will be charged.

**Note**: EOAs can directly interact with the FunctionsRouter contract using a web3 library, such as web3.js or ethers.js.

### Cancel subscription

(Image: Image)

To cancel a subscription:

1. Connect your EOA to the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager.
2. Cancel your subscription, providing the *Subscription Balance* receiver account address. The Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager handles the following processes:
   1. Invokes the `cancelSubscription` function on the FunctionsRouter contract, deleting the *Subscription ID* and removing all associated consumers.
   2. Transfers the remaining *Subscription Balance* to the specified receiver account.

**Note**: EOAs can directly interact with the FunctionsRouter contract using their preferred web3 library, such as web3.js or ethers.js.

**Note**: Subscriptions cannot be canceled while there are in-flight requests. Furthermore, any expired requests (requests that have yet to receive a response within 5 minutes) must be timed out before cancellation.

### Transferring ownership of a Subscription

Transferring ownership is currently only supported using the [Functions Hardhat Starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) or the [Functions Toolkit NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit):

1. Use the `functions-sub-transfer` command to initiate the transfer of ownership by specifying the new owner's address.
2. As a prerequisite, the prospective owner must be part of the `allowedSenders` registry within the [TermsOfServiceAllowList contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/v1_0_0/accessControl/TermsOfServiceAllowList.sol). This verifies their acceptance of the Chainlink Functions' Terms of Service (ToS).
3. The prospective owner should use the [Functions Hardhat Starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) and run the `functions-sub-accept` command to confirm the ownership transfer.

**Note**: This guide will be updated as soon as the Chainlink Functions Subscription Manager supports ownership transfers.

# Chainlink Functions Billing

## Request costs

To send Chainlink Functions requests, you must maintain a sufficient amount of LINK in your subscription balance. Because Chainlink Functions follows the [Request and Receive Data](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) model, billing is done in two steps:

1. During the **request** step, the cost to fulfill a Chainlink Functions request is **estimated** and blocked on the subscription balance by adding it to the subscription reservation.
2. During the **receive** step, the exact fulfillment cost is **calculated**, then billed to the subscription account, and the subscription reservation is removed.

You can break down total costs into the following components:

- Gas cost: This cost is paid back to the transmitter oracle in LINK for fulfilling the request.
- Premium fees: These fees are paid in LINK to compensate nodes for their work and for the maintenance of the FunctionsRouter contract.

Gas cost calculation includes the following variables:

- Gas price: The current gas price fluctuates depending on network conditions.
- Overestimated gas price: refers to a deliberately higher gas price estimation to account for potential price fluctuations between the time a request is made and the time Chainlink Functions fulfills it. By setting the gas price higher than the current one, Chainlink Functions increases the likelihood that the request will be fulfilled, even if gas prices rise unexpectedly in the short term. The overestimation is calculated as a percentage increase over the current gas price.
- Callback gas: The amount of gas used for the callback request. See the [Cost Calculation](#cost-calculation-fulfillment) section.
- Callback gas limit: The maximum amount of gas that can be used to call the `handleOracleFulfillment` callback function of the consumer contract in order to provide the response. See the [Cost Simulation](#cost-simulation-reservation) section.
- Gas overhead: The amount of gas used by the FunctionsRouter and FunctionsCoordinator contracts. It is an estimate of the total gas cost of fulfilling a request.
- Native to LINK translation: Your subscription balance can be billed only in LINK tokens.
  - Translate the network's native gas tokens to LINK: The total gas cost in *native* units is translated using the correct [Price Feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses). For example, on Sepolia, the translation uses the ETH/LINK Price Feed, and on Polygon, the translation uses POL/LINK Price Feed.
  - Fallback Wei to LINK ratio: In the unlikely event that the *Native to LINK* price data feed is unavailable, the fallback translation is used. You can find this ratio by running the `getConfig` function in the FunctionsCoordinator contract. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page to find the contract addresses for each network.

### Cost simulation (reservation)

During the **request** step:

1. The total cost in LINK is **estimated** using the following formula:

   ```
   total estimated gas cost in LINK = (Overestimated gas price * (Gas overhead + Callback gas limit)) / Native to LINK translation

   total estimated cost in LINK = total estimated gas cost + premium fees
   ```

   All networks have USD-denominated premium fees. This means that the fixed premium fee is denominated in USD, but no USD is ever used. The LINK equivalent of this fee is calculated at request time.

2. The total estimated cost is then added to the subscription reservation.

### Cost calculation (fulfillment)

When a DON's oracle reports the response, subscription accounts are charged based on the gas amount used in the callback:

1. The total cost in LINK is **calculated** using the following formula:

   ```
   total gas cost in LINK = (Gas price * (Gas overhead + Callback gas)) / Native to LINK translation

   total cost in LINK = total gas cost + premium fees
   ```

   All networks have USD-denominated premium fees. This means that the fixed premium fee is denominated in USD, but no USD is ever used. The LINK equivalent of this fee is calculated at request time.

2. The FunctionsRouter contract performs several accounting movements.

### Cost calculation example

This is an example of cost estimation for a request and then cost calculation at fulfillment.

For networks with USD-denominated premium fees, the premium fees are set in USD, but no USD is ever used. The LINK equivalent of the fee is calculated at request time, and then deducted from your subscription in LINK at response time.

#### Cost Simulation (Reservation)

| Parameter               | Value         |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Overestimated gas price | 9 gwei        |
| Callback gas limit      | 300000        |
| Gas overhead            | 185000        |
| Premium fee             | 320 cents USD |

1. Calculate the total estimated gas cost in LINK, using an overestimated gas price, the gas overhead, and the full callback gas limit:

   | Gas cost calculation                                          | Total estimated gas cost    |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Overestimated gas price x (Gas overhead + Callback gas limit) |                             |
   | 9 gwei x (300000 + 185000)                                    | 4365000 gwei (0.004365 ETH) |

2. Convert the gas cost to LINK using the [LINK/ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/link-eth).
   For this example, assume the feed returns a conversion value of Ξ0.007 ETH per 1 LINK.

   | ETH to LINK cost conversion   | Total gas cost (LINK) |
   | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
   | 0.004365 ETH / 0.007 ETH/LINK | 0.62 LINK             |

3. Convert the USD-denominated premium fee to LINK using the [LINK/USD feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/link-usd).
   For this example, assume the feed returns a conversion value of $20.00 USD per 1 LINK:

   | USD to LINK cost conversion | Premium fee (LINK) |
   | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
   | $3.20 USD / 20.00 USD/LINK  | 0.16 LINK          |

4. Add the converted premium fee to get the estimated cost for a subscription reservation:

   | Adding converted LINK premium       | Maximum request cost (LINK) |
   | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Total gas cost (LINK) + Premium fee |                             |
   | 0.62 LINK + 0.16 LINK               | 0.78 LINK                   |

For this example request, 0.78 LINK is reserved from your subscription balance, but not yet deducted. When the request is fulfilled, the exact request cost is deducted. The estimated cost of a request is overestimated to allow for 99% of gas price fluctuation increases in between request and response time.

#### Cost calculation (fulfillment)

| Parameter                     | Value     |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Gas price                     | 1.5 gwei  |
| Callback gas                  | 200000    |
| Gas overhead                  | 185000    |
| Premium fee converted to LINK | 0.16 LINK |

1. Calculate the total gas cost:

   | Gas cost calculation                      | Total gas cost              |
   | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Gas price x (Gas overhead + Callback gas) |                             |
   | 1.5 gwei x (200000 + 185000)              | 577500 gwei (0.0005775 ETH) |

2. Convert the gas cost to LINK using the [LINK/ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/link-eth).
   For this example, assume the feed returns a conversion value of Ξ0.007 ETH per 1 LINK.

   | ETH to LINK cost conversion    | Total gas cost (LINK) |
   | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
   | 0.0005775 ETH / 0.007 ETH/LINK | 0.0825 LINK           |

3. The premium fee was converted from USD to LINK at the time of the request. Add this converted premium fee to get the total cost of a request:

   | Adding premium fee                  | Total request cost (LINK) |
   | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | Total gas cost (LINK) + premium fee |                           |
   | 0.0825 LINK + 0.16 LINK             | 0.2425 LINK               |

This example request would cost 0.2425 LINK when it is fulfilled. The subscription reservation for the 0.78 LINK is released, and the actual cost of 0.2425 LINK is deducted from your subscription balance.

## Minimum balance for uploading encrypted secrets

If you choose to store the encrypted secrets with the DON (learn more on the [Secrets Management page](/chainlink-functions/resources/secrets)), then one of your subscriptions must maintain a balance greater than the minimum required for uploading encrypted secrets. This balance is blockchain-specific. You can find the specific values for each blockchain on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page.
**Note**: Uploading encrypted secrets is free of charge. However, to prevent misuse of Chainlink Functions, you are required to maintain a minimum balance in one of the subscriptions owned by your externally-owned account (EOA) before you can upload encrypted secrets to a DON.

## Withdrawing funds

To withdraw your LINK balance, you must first cancel your subscription. To prevent misuse of Chainlink Functions, any subscription with fulfilled requests below the *request threshold* will incur a cancellation fee. Both the request threshold and the cancellation fee are blockchain-specific. You can find their values for each blockchain on the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page.

**Example 1**:

- **Request Threshold**: Two requests
- **Cancellation Fee**: 0.5 LINK
- **Your Balance**: 0.4 LINK
- **Number of Fulfilled Requests**: One
- **Outcome**: Canceling your subscription results in a non-refundable balance

**Example 2**:

- **Request Threshold**: Two requests
- **Cancellation Fee**: 0.5 LINK
- **Your Balance**: 1 LINK
- **Number of Fulfilled Requests**: One
- **Outcome**: You will receive 0.5 LINK if you cancel your subscription

**Example 3**:

- **Request Threshold**: Two requests
- **Cancellation Fee**: 0.5 LINK
- **Your Balance**: 1 LINK
- **Number of Fulfilled Requests**: Two or more
- **Outcome**: You will receive 1 LINK if you cancel your subscription. Your subscription will not incur the cancellation fee

## API Query Parameters Tutorial
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-query-parameters

# Call an API with HTTP Query Parameters
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/tutorials/api-query-parameters


This tutorial shows you how to send a request to a Decentralized Oracle Network to call the [Cryptocompare GET /data/pricemultifull API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price\&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint). After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) completes offchain computation and aggregation, it returns the asset price for ETH/USD to your smart contract. This guide also shows you how to configure HTTP query parameters to request different asset prices.

> **NOTE**
>
> Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You must ensure that the data sources or APIs specified in requests
> are of sufficient quality and have the proper availability for your use case. You are responsible for complying with
> the licensing agreements for all data providers that you connect with through Chainlink Functions. Violations of data
> provider licensing agreements or the [terms](https://chain.link/terms) can result in suspension or termination of your
> Chainlink Functions account.

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the `ETH/USD` price. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [*examples/2-call-api* directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/2-call-api).

To run the example:

1. Open the file `request.js`, which is located in the `2-call-api` folder.

2. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

3. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/2-call-api/request.js
   ```

   The script runs your function in a sandbox environment before making an onchain transaction:

   ```text
   $ node examples/2-call-api/request.js
   secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version
   Start simulation...
    Simulation result {

    }

      errorString: '',
      returnDataBytesHexstring: '0x',
      fulfillmentCode: 0
    }

    ✅ Decoded response to uint256:  342162n
   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request is first run on a sandbox environment to ensure it is correctly configured.

   - The fulfillment costs are estimated before making the request.

   - Your request was successfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is [0xbbe473ccc6593b6f3baf30fd66b2329b05a32fe0321a319d09142f4b9ba4547c](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xbbe473ccc6593b6f3baf30fd66b2329b05a32fe0321a319d09142f4b9ba4547c) and the request ID is `0xe55201188012e3ec198427937f7897729999ab7b287207ff8f0c157a9662e5f0`.

## Examine the code

### FunctionsConsumerExample.sol

### JavaScript example

#### source.js

The Decentralized Oracle Network will run the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/2-call-api/source.js). The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) to make HTTP requests. To request the `ETH/USD` price, the source code calls the `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` URL. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/javascript-source#http-requests) documentation, you see that you must provide the following parameters:

- `url`: `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull`
- `params`: The query parameters object:

  ```
  {
    fsyms: fromSymbol,
    tsyms: toSymbol
  }
  ```

To check the expected API response, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` or run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "RAW": {
    "ETH": {
      "USD": {
        "TYPE": "5",
        "MARKET": "CCCAGG",
        "FROMSYMBOL": "ETH",
        "TOSYMBOL": "USD",
        "FLAGS": "2049",
        "PRICE": 2867.04,
        "LASTUPDATE": 1650896942,
        "MEDIAN": 2866.2,
        "LASTVOLUME": 0.16533939,
        "LASTVOLUMETO": 474.375243849,
        "LASTTRADEID": "1072154517",
        "VOLUMEDAY": 195241.78281014622,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO": 556240560.4621655,
        "VOLUME24HOUR": 236248.94641103,
        ...
}
```

The price is located at `RAW,ETH,USD,PRICE`.

The main steps of the scripts are:

- Fetch `fromSymbol` and `toSymbol` from `args`.
- Construct the HTTP object `cryptoCompareRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`.
- Make the HTTP call.
- Read the asset price from the response.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.

#### request.js

This explanation focuses on the [request.js](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/2-call-api/request.js) script and shows how to use the [Chainlink Functions NPM package](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit) in your own JavaScript/TypeScript project to send requests to a DON. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The script imports:

- [path](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) and [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) : Used to read the [source file](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/2-call-api/source.js).
- [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/): Ethers.js library, enables the script to interact with the blockchain.
- `@chainlink/functions-toolkit`: Chainlink Functions NPM package. All its utilities are documented in the [NPM README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-toolkit/blob/main/README.md).
- `@chainlink/env-enc`: A tool for loading and storing encrypted environment variables. Read the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc) to learn more.
- `../abi/functionsClient.json`: The abi of the contract your script will interact with. **Note**: The script was tested with this [FunctionsConsumerExample contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkFunctions/FunctionsConsumerExample.sol).

The script has two hardcoded values that you have to change using your own Functions consumer contract and subscription ID:

```javascript
const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
```

The primary function that the script executes is `makeRequestSepolia`. This function consists of five main parts:

1. Definition of necessary identifiers:
   - `routerAddress`: Chainlink Functions router address on Sepolia.
   - `donId`: Identifier of the DON that will fulfill your requests on Sepolia.
   - `explorerUrl`: Block explorer URL of the Sepolia testnet.
   - `source`: The source code must be a string object. That's why we use `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and then call `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
   - `args`: During the execution of your function, These arguments are passed to the source code. The `args` value is `["ETH", "USD"]`, which fetches the current `ETH/USD` price. You can adapt `args` to fetch another asset price. See the [CryptoCompare API docs](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price\&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint) to get the list of supported symbols.
   - `gasLimit`: Maximum gas that Chainlink Functions can use when transmitting the response to your contract.
   - Initialization of ethers `signer` and `provider` objects. The signer is used to make transactions on the blockchain, and the provider reads data from the blockchain.

2. Simulating your request in a local sandbox environment:
   - Use `simulateScript` from the Chainlink Functions NPM package.
   - Read the `response` of the simulation. If successful, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.uint256` in this example).

3. Estimating the costs:
   - Initialize a `SubscriptionManager` from the Functions NPM package, then call the `estimateFunctionsRequestCost`.
   - The response is returned in Juels (1 LINK = 10\*\*18 Juels). Use the `ethers.utils.formatEther` utility function to convert the output to LINK.

4. Making a Chainlink Functions request:
   - Initialize your functions consumer contract using the contract address, abi, and ethers signer.
   - Call the `sendRequest` function of your consumer contract.

5. Waiting for the response:
   - Initialize a `ResponseListener` from the Functions NPM package and then call the `listenForResponseFromTransaction` function to wait for a response. By default, this function waits for five minutes.
   - Upon reception of the response, use the Functions NPM package `decodeResult` function and `ReturnType` enum to decode the response to the expected returned type (`ReturnType.uint256` in this example).

# Request Computation
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/tutorials/simple-computation


This tutorial shows you how to run computations on the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). The example code computes the [geometric mean](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/geometric-mean.html) of numbers in a list. After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes offchain computation and aggregation, it returns the result to your smart contract.

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the average (geometric mean) from a list of numbers `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`. Read the [Examine the code](#examine-the-code) section for a detailed description of the code example.

You can locate the scripts used in this tutorial in the [*examples/1-simple-computation* directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/functions-examples/examples/1-simple-computation).

To run the example:

1. Open the file `request.js`, which is located in the `1-simple-computation` folder.

2. Replace the consumer contract address and the subscription ID with your own values.

   ```javascript
   const consumerAddress = "0x8dFf78B7EE3128D00E90611FBeD20A71397064D9" // REPLACE this with your Functions consumer address
   const subscriptionId = 3 // REPLACE this with your subscription ID
   ```

3. Make a request:

   ```shell
   node examples/1-simple-computation/request.js
   ```

   The script runs your function in a sandbox environment before making an onchain transaction:

   ```text
   $ node examples/1-simple-computation/request.js

   secp256k1 unavailable, reverting to browser version
   Start simulation...
   Simulation result {
   capturedTerminalOutput: 'calculate geometric mean of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\ngeometric mean is: 4.53\n',

   totalCostInJuels: 240613623834519812n,
   responseBytesHexstring: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c5',
   errorString: '',
   returnDataBytesHexstring: '0x',
   fulfillmentCode: 0
   }

   ✅ Decoded response to uint256:  453n
   ```

   The output of the example gives you the following information:

   - Your request is first run on a sandbox environment to ensure it is correctly configured.

   - The fulfillment costs are estimated before making the request.

   - Your request was successfully sent to Chainlink Functions. The transaction in this example is [0x7df8240d23ef5c951ea73634b2346a459c8cd5b9a0bf76dbe0bb4d912e099b22](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x7df8240d23ef5c951ea73634b2346a459c8cd5b9a0bf76dbe0bb4d912e099b22) and the request ID is `0x91a72a36a94ddedfc9e7bcfe33aaa13dd5747c4e985d9baa8c0c34175ac6c715`.

   - The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.240613623834519812 LINK`.

   - The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c5`. Decoding it offchain to `uint256` gives you a result: `453`.

### FunctionsConsumerExample.sol

### JavaScript example

#### source.js

The Decentralized Oracle Network will run the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/functions-examples/examples/1-simple-computation/source.js). The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps.

The main steps are:

- Read the numbers provided as arguments in the `args` setting. Because `args` is an array of `string`, call `parseInt` to convert from `string` to `number`. **Note**: `args` contains string values that are injected into the JavaScript source code when the Decentralized Oracle Network executes your function. You can access theses values from your JavaScript code using the name `args`.
- Calculate the average (geometric mean): First, compute the product of the numbers. Then, calculate the nth root of the product where `n` is the length of `args`.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because Solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. There are other helper functions that you could use depending on the response type:

  - `Functions.encodeUint256`: Takes a positive JavaScript integer number and returns a Buffer of 32 bytes representing a uint256 type in Solidity.
  - `Functions.encodeInt256`: Takes a JavaScript integer number and returns a Buffer of 32 bytes representing an int256 type in Solidity.
  - `Functions.encodeString`: Takes a JavaScript string and returns a Buffer representing a string type in Solidity.

  **Note**: You are not required to use these encoding functions as long as the JavaScript code returns a Buffer representing the bytes array returned onchain. Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.

## VRF Overview

# Chainlink VRF
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf


<Vrf2_5Common callout="security" />

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified onchain before any consuming applications can use it. This process helps ensure that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, smart contract developers, users, miners, or block builders\*.

\*In the unlikely event that an adversary compromises VRF's randomness-generating secret key and obtains the ability to construct blocks on the target chain, they could strongly bias the result.

> **NOTE: Migrate to V2.5**
>
> Follow the [migration guide](/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2) to learn how VRF has changed in V2.5 and to get example
> code.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that rely on unpredictable outcomes:

- Building blockchain games and NFTs.
- Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
- Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

VRF v2.5 includes [all the original benefits of v2](https://blog.chain.link/vrf-v2-mainnet-launch/) and the following additional benefits:

- Easier upgrades to future versions.
- The option to pay for requests in either LINK or native tokens.

Learn how to [migrate to VRF v2.5](/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2).

For help with your specific use case, [contact us](https://chain.link/contact) to connect with one of our Solutions Architects. You can also ask questions about Chainlink VRF on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=chainlink).

## Two methods to request randomness

Similarly to VRF v2, VRF v2.5 will offer two methods for requesting randomness:

- [Subscription](/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription): Create a subscription account and fund its balance with either native tokens or LINK. You can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.
- [Direct funding](/vrf/v2-5/overview/direct-funding): Consuming contracts directly pay with either native tokens or LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough funds to pay for randomness requests.

## Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another. Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

# Getting Started with Chainlink VRF V2.5
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/getting-started


> **NOTE: Requirements**

In this guide, you will learn about generating randomness on blockchains. This includes learning how to implement a Request and Receive cycle with Chainlink oracles and how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus. Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf), also known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [Data Feeds Getting Started](/data-feeds/getting-started) guide explains how to consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted onchain by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of randomness is stored onchain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the **[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in a single location.
To learn more about VRF requests funding, see [Subscription limits](/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription#subscription-limits).

## How can I use Chainlink VRF?

In this section, you will create an application that uses Chainlink VRF to generate randomness. The contract used in this application has a [*Game of Thrones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) theme.

After the contract requests randomness from Chainlink VRF, the result of the randomness will transform into a number between 1 and 20, mimicking the rolling of a 20 sided die. Each number represents a *Game of Thrones* house. If the dice land on the value 1, the user is assigned house Targaryan, 2 for Lannister, and so on. A full list of houses can be found [here](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Great_House).

When rolling the dice, it uses an `address` variable to track which address is assigned to each house.

The contract has the following functions:

- `rollDice`: This submits a randomness request to Chainlink VRF
- `fulfillRandomWords`: The function that the Oracle uses to send the result back
- `house`: To see the assigned house of an address

**Note**: to jump straight to the entire implementation, you can [open the VRFD20.sol contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/VRFD20.sol) in Remix.

### Create and fund a subscription

Chainlink VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay your use of Chainlink VRF requests.
For this example, create a new subscription on the Sepolia testnet as explained [here](/vrf/v2-5/subscription/create-manage).

Your subscription has two balances - one for LINK and one for the native token you're using (in this case, Sepolia ETH). You can choose to pay for VRF requests using either balance.

### Importing contracts

Chainlink maintains a [library of contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts) that make consuming data from oracles easier. For Chainlink VRF, you will use:

- [`VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol) that must be imported and extended from the contract that you create.
- [`VRFV2PlusClient`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol) to format your requests to VRF.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol";
import {VRFV2PlusClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol";

contract VRFD20 is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {

}
```

### Contract variables

This example is adapted for [Sepolia testnet](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks#ethereum-sepolia-testnet) but you can change the configuration and make it run for any [supported network](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks).

```solidity
uint256 s_subscriptionId;
address vrfCoordinator = 0x9DdfaCa8183c41ad55329BdeeD9F6A8d53168B1B;
bytes32 s_keyHash = 0x787d74caea10b2b357790d5b5247c2f63d1d91572a9846f780606e4d953677ae;
uint32 callbackGasLimit = 40000;
uint16 requestConfirmations = 3;
uint32 numWords =  1;
```

- `uint256 s_subscriptionId`: The subscription ID that this contract uses for funding requests. Initialized in the `constructor`.
- `address vrfCoordinator`: The address of the Chainlink VRF Coordinator contract.
- `bytes32 s_keyHash`: The gas lane key hash value, which is the maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei. It functions as an ID of the offchain VRF job that runs in response to requests.
- `uint32 callbackGasLimit`: The limit for how much gas to use for the callback request to your contract's `fulfillRandomWords` function. It must be less than the `maxGasLimit` on the coordinator contract. Adjust this value for larger requests depending on how your `fulfillRandomWords` function processes and stores the received random values. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback will fail and your subscription is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.
- `uint16 requestConfirmations`: How many confirmations the Chainlink node should wait before responding. The longer the node waits, the more secure the random value is. It must be greater than the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` value on the coordinator contract. For Sepolia, the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` value is 3. You can check this and the other configuration values on the coordinator contract by querying [the `s_config` value in the Sepolia Etherscan block explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9DdfaCa8183c41ad55329BdeeD9F6A8d53168B1B#readContract#F12).
- `uint32 numWords`: How many random values to request. If you can use several random values in a single callback, you can reduce the amount of gas that you spend per random value. In this example, each transaction requests one random value.

To keep track of addresses that roll the dice, the contract uses mappings. [Mappings](https://medium.com/upstate-interactive/mappings-in-solidity-explained-in-under-two-minutes-ecba88aff96e) are unique key-value pair data structures similar to hash tables in Java.

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => address) private s_rollers;
mapping(address => uint256) private s_results;
```

- `s_rollers` stores a mapping between the `requestID` (returned when a request is made), and the address of the roller. This is so the contract can keep track of who to assign the result to when it comes back.
- `s_results` stores the roller and the result of the dice roll.

### Initializing the contract

The subscription ID must be initialized in the `constructor` of the contract. To use `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` properly, you must also pass the VRF coordinator address into its constructor.
The address that creates the smart contract is the owner of the contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol";
import {VRFV2PlusClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol";

contract VRFD20 is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {
    // variables
    // ...

    // constructor
    constructor(uint256 subscriptionId) VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus(vrfCoordinator) {
        s_subscriptionId = subscriptionId;
    }
    ...
}
```

### `rollDice` function

The `rollDice` function will complete the following tasks:

1. Check if the roller has already rolled since each roller can only ever be assigned to a single house.
2. Request randomness by calling the VRF coordinator.
3. Store the `requestId` and roller address.
4. Emit an event to signal that the dice is rolling.

You must add a `ROLL_IN_PROGRESS` constant to signify that the dice has been rolled but the result is not yet returned. Also add a `DiceRolled` event to the contract.

Only the owner of the contract can execute the `rollDice` function.

This `rollDice` function is configured so that you pay for VRF requests using LINK by default. If you want to pay for your VRF request with Sepolia ETH instead, set `nativePayment` to `true`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol";
import {VRFV2PlusClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol";

contract VRFD20 is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {
    // variables
    uint256 private constant ROLL_IN_PROGRESS = 42;
    // ...

    // events
    event DiceRolled(uint256 indexed requestId, address indexed roller);
    // ...

    // ...
    // { constructor }
    // ...

    // rollDice function
    function rollDice(address roller) public onlyOwner returns (uint256 requestId) {
        require(s_results[roller] == 0, "Already rolled");
        // Will revert if subscription is not set and funded.

       requestId = s_vrfCoordinator.requestRandomWords(
            VRFV2PlusClient.RandomWordsRequest({
                keyHash: s_keyHash,
                subId: s_subscriptionId,
                requestConfirmations: requestConfirmations,
                callbackGasLimit: callbackGasLimit,
                numWords: numWords,
                // Set nativePayment to true to pay for VRF requests with Sepolia ETH instead of LINK
                extraArgs: VRFV2PlusClient._argsToBytes(VRFV2PlusClient.ExtraArgsV1({nativePayment: false}))
            })
        );

        s_rollers[requestId] = roller;
        s_results[roller] = ROLL_IN_PROGRESS;
        emit DiceRolled(requestId, roller);
    }
}
```

### `fulfillRandomWords` function

`fulfillRandomWords` is a special function defined within the `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` contract that our contract extends from. The coordinator sends the result of our generated `randomWords` back to `fulfillRandomWords`. You will implement some functionality here to deal with the result:

1. Change the result to a number between 1 and 20 inclusively. Note that `randomWords` is an array that could contain several random values. In this example, request 1 random value.
2. Assign the transformed value to the address in the `s_results` mapping variable.
3. Emit a `DiceLanded` event.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol";
import {VRFV2PlusClient} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol";

contract VRFD20 is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {
    // ...
    // { variables }
    // ...

    // events
    // ...
    event DiceLanded(uint256 indexed requestId, uint256 indexed result);

    // ...
    // { constructor }
    // ...

    // ...
    // { rollDice function }
    // ...

    // fulfillRandomWords function
    function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] calldata randomWords) internal override {

        // transform the result to a number between 1 and 20 inclusively
        uint256 d20Value = (randomWords[0] % 20) + 1;

        // assign the transformed value to the address in the s_results mapping variable
        s_results[s_rollers[requestId]] = d20Value;

        // emitting event to signal that dice landed
        emit DiceLanded(requestId, d20Value);
    }
}
```

### `house` function

Finally, the `house` function returns the house of an address.

To have a list of the house's names, create the `getHouseName` function that is called in the `house` function.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import {VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus} from "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol";

contract VRFD20 is VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus {
    // ...
    // { variables }
    // ...

    // ...
    // { events }
    // ...

    // ...
    // { constructor }
    // ...

    // ...
    // { rollDice function }
    // ...

    // ...
    // { fulfillRandomWords function }
    // ...

    // house function
    function house(address player) public view returns (string memory) {
        // dice has not yet been rolled to this address
        require(s_results[player] != 0, "Dice not rolled");

        // not waiting for the result of a thrown dice
        require(s_results[player] != ROLL_IN_PROGRESS, "Roll in progress");

        // returns the house name from the name list function
        return getHouseName(s_results[player]);
    }

    // getHouseName function
    function getHouseName(uint256 id) private pure returns (string memory) {
        // array storing the list of house's names
        string[20] memory houseNames = [
            "Targaryen",
            "Lannister",
            "Stark",
            "Tyrell",
            "Baratheon",
            "Martell",
            "Tully",
            "Bolton",
            "Greyjoy",
            "Arryn",
            "Frey",
            "Mormont",
            "Tarley",
            "Dayne",
            "Umber",

            "Karstark"
        ];

        // returns the house name given an index
        return houseNames[id - 1];
    }
}
```

You have now completed all necessary functions to generate randomness and assign the user a *Game of Thrones* house. We've added a few helper functions in there to make using the contract easier and more flexible. You can deploy and interact with the complete contract in Remix.

## How do I deploy to testnet?

You will deploy this contract on the Sepolia test network. You must have some Sepolia testnet ETH in your MetaMask account to pay for the gas for each contract interaction with the Sepolia network.

You can choose to pay for your VRF requests in either Sepolia ETH or testnet LINK. The `rollDice` function is written to use LINK by default. If you want to change to using Sepolia, set `nativePayment` to `true` before deploying your contract.

You can request both testnet LINK and testnet ETH from [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia). Testnet ETH is also available from several [public faucets](https://faucetlink.to/sepolia).

This deployment is slightly different than the example in the [Deploy Your First Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) guide. In this case, you pass in parameters to the constructor upon deployment.

Once compiled, you'll see a dropdown menu that looks like this in the deploy pane:

(Image: Image)

Select the `VRFD20` contract or the name that you gave to your contract.

Click the caret arrow on the right hand side of **Deploy** to expand the parameter fields, and paste your subscription ID.

(Image: Image)

Then click the `Deploy` button and use your MetaMask account to confirm the transaction.

> **NOTE: Address, Key Hashes and more**
>
> For a full reference of the addresses, key hashes and fees for each network, see [VRF Supported
> Networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks).

At this point, your contract should be successfully deployed. However, it can't request anything because it is not yet approved to use the LINK or Sepolia ETH balance in your subscription. If you click `rollDice`, the transaction will revert.

## How do I add my contract to my subscription account?

After you deploy your contract, you must add it as an approved consumer contract so it can use the subscription balance when requesting for randomness.

1. Find your contract address in Remix under **Deployed Contracts** on the bottom left, and copy the contract address:

   (Image: Image)

2. Go to the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link), open the details page for your subscription, and add your deployed contract address to the list of consumers:

   (Image: Image)

## How do I test `rollDice`?

After you open the deployed contract tab in the bottom left, the function buttons are available. Find `rollDice` and click the caret to expand the parameter fields. Enter an Ethereum address to specify a "dice roller", and click `rollDice`.

It takes a few minutes for the transaction to confirm and the response to be sent back. You can get your house by clicking the `house` function button with the address passed in `rollDice`. After the response is sent back, you'll be assigned a *Game of Thrones* house!

This guide explains how to estimate VRF 2.5 costs for both the subscription and direct funding methods.

## Understanding transaction costs

<TabsContent sharedStore="vrfMethod" client:visible>
  <Fragment slot="tab.1">Subscription</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Direct funding</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    For Chainlink VRF v2.5 to fulfill your requests, you must maintain enough funds in your subscription balance. Gas cost calculation includes the following variables:

    - **Gas price:** The current gas price, which fluctuates depending on network conditions.

    - **Callback gas:** The amount of gas used for the callback request that returns your requested random values.

    - **Verification gas:** The amount of gas used to verify randomness onchain.

    The gas price depends on current network conditions. The callback gas depends on your callback function, and the number of random values in your request. The cost of each request is final only after the transaction is complete, but you define the limits you are willing to spend for the request with the following variables:

    - **Gas lane:** The maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei. Define this limit by specifying the appropriate `keyHash` in your request. The limits of each gas lane are important for handling gas price spikes when Chainlink VRF bumps the gas price to fulfill your request quickly.

    - **Callback gas limit:** Specifies the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on the callback request. Define this limit by specifying the `callbackGasLimit` value in your request.

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    For Chainlink VRF v2.5 to fulfill your requests, you must maintain enough funds in your consuming contract.

    Gas cost calculation includes the following variables:

    - **Callback gas:** The amount of gas used for the callback request that returns your requested random values. The callback gas depends on your callback function and the number of random values in your request. Set the **callback gas limit** to specify the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on the callback request.

    - **Number of random values requested:** The number of random values (`numWords`) per request to VRF.

    - **Gas price:** The current gas price, which fluctuates depending on network conditions.

    - **Coordinator overhead gas:** The amount of gas used to verify randomness onchain. This consists of two components:
      - **Coordinator overhead gas (Native or LINK):** The coordinator overhead gas has different values depending on whether you're using LINK or native tokens.
      - **Coordinator overhead gas per word:** The amount of additional gas the coordinator uses per random value ("word") that you request.

    - **Wrapper overhead gas:** The amount of gas used by the VRF Wrapper contract.

    Because the consuming contract directly pays for the request, the cost is calculated during the request and not during the callback when the randomness is fulfilled. Test your callback function to learn how to correctly estimate the callback gas limit.

    - If the gas limit is underestimated, the callback fails and the consuming contract is still charged for the work done to generate the requested random values.
    - If the gas limit is overestimated, the callback function will be executed but your contract is not refunded for the excess gas amount that you paid.

    Make sure that your consuming contracts have enough funds in either LINK or native tokens to cover the transaction costs. If the consuming contract doesn't have enough funds, your request will revert.

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    You need to pre-fund your subscription enough to meet the [minimum subscription balance](/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription#minimum-subscription-balance)
    in order to have a buffer against gas volatility.

    After the request is complete, the final gas cost is recorded based on how much gas is used for the verification and callback.
    The actual cost of the request is deducted from your subscription balance.

    The total gas cost in wei for your request uses the following formula:

    ```
    (Gas price * (Verification gas + Callback gas)) = total gas cost
    ```

    If you're paying for VRF in LINK, the total gas cost is converted to LINK using the ETH/LINK data feed. In the unlikely event that the data feed is
    unavailable, the VRF coordinator uses the `fallbackWeiPerUnitLink` value for the conversion instead. The
    `fallbackWeiPerUnitLink` value is defined in the
    [coordinator contract](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) for your selected network.

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    The final gas cost to fulfill randomness is estimated based on how much gas is expected for the verification and callback. The total gas cost in wei uses the following formula:

    ```
    (Gas price * (Coordinator gas overhead
                  + Callback gas limit
                  + Wrapper gas overhead)) = total gas cost
    ```

    The total gas cost is converted to LINK using the ETH/LINK data feed. In the unlikely event that the data feed is unavailable, the VRF Wrapper uses the `fallbackWeiPerUnitLink` value for the conversion instead. The `fallbackWeiPerUnitLink` value is defined in the [VRF v2.5 Wrapper contract](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) for your selected network.

    The maximum allowed `callbackGasLimit` value for your requests is defined in the [Coordinator contract supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page. Because the VRF v2.5 Wrapper adds gas overheads, your `callbackGasLimit` must not exceed `maxGasLimit - wrapperGasOverhead`.

### Apply premium

<TabsContent sharedStore="vrfMethod" client:visible>
  <Fragment slot="tab.1">Subscription</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Direct funding</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    The premium is charged as a percentage of the overall gas cost. The premium is defined in the [coordinator contract](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks). Premium percentages are listed there as whole integers. For example, a 20% premium is listed as `20`.

    ```
    (total gas cost) * ((100 + Premium percentage) / 100) = total request cost
    ```

    The total request cost is charged to your subscription balance. Since you have the option to pay for VRF requests either in LINK or the native token for the network you're using, your subscription can have both a LINK balance and a native token balance. The premium is higher when you pay with native tokens than when you pay with LINK. For example, the premium percentage for using Ethereum is 24 if you pay with Ethereum, and 20 if you pay with LINK.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    The premium is divided in two parts:

    - Wrapper premium: This premium is charged as a percentage of the overall gas cost. Premium percentages are listed there as whole integers. For example, a 20% premium is listed as `20`. You can find the percentage for your network in the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.
    - Coordinator premium: A flat fee. This premium is defined in the `fulfillmentFlatFeeLinkPPMTier1` parameter in millionths of LINK. You can find the flat fee of the coordinator for your network in the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.

    ```
    (Coordinator premium
      + (total gas cost) * ((100 + Premium percentage) / 100)) = total request cost
    ```

    The total request cost is charged to your consuming contract. The premium is higher when you pay with native tokens than when you pay with LINK. For example, the premium percentage for using Ethereum is 24 if you pay with Ethereum, and 20 if you pay with LINK.

### Subscription cost examples

These are example calculations of a VRF subscription request on Ethereum, shown in both ETH and LINK. The values for other supported networks
are available on the [Supported Networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.
The examples show how to estimate the following:

- The [minimum subscription balance](/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription#minimum-subscription-balance), which is a higher amount you need to reserve before your request is processed. This provides a buffer in case gas prices go higher when processing the request. The VRF Subscription Manager displays your minimum subscription balance as **Max Cost**.
- The actual cost of the request after it is processed, which is lower than the minimum subscription balance.

#### Estimate minimum subscription balance

These example calculations show an estimated minimum subscription balance for using VRF on Ethereum, shown in both ETH and LINK. The premium is higher when you pay with native tokens than when you pay with LINK.

<TabsContent sharedStore="feePaymentMethod" client:visible>
  <Fragment slot="tab.1">Paying in LINK</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Paying in ETH</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    | Parameter            | Value    |
    | -------------------- | -------- |
    | Gas lane             | 500 gwei |
    | Callback gas limit   | 100000   |
    | Max verification gas | 200000   |
    | Premium percentage   | 20       |

    1. Calculate the total gas cost, using the maximum possible gas price for the selected gas lane, the estimated maximum verification gas, and the full callback gas limit:

       | Gas cost calculation                          | Total gas cost            |
       | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
       | Gas price x (Verification gas + Callback gas) |                           |
       | 500 gwei x (200000 + 100000)                  | 150000000 gwei (0.15 ETH) |

    2. Apply the premium percentage to get the total maximum cost of a request:

       | Applying premium percentage                              | Maximum request cost (ETH) |
       | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
       | Total gas cost (ETH) \* ((100 + premium percentage)/100) |                            |
       | 0.15 ETH \* ((100 + 20)/100)                             | 0.18 ETH                   |

    3. Convert the total cost to LINK using the [LINK/ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/link-eth).
       For this example, assume the feed returns a conversion value of Ξ0.005 ETH per 1 LINK.

       | ETH to LINK cost conversion | Maximum request cost (LINK) |
       | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
       | 0.18 ETH / 0.005 ETH/LINK   | 36 LINK                     |

    For this example request to go through, you need to reserve a minimum subscription balance of 36 LINK, but that does not mean the actual request will cost 36 LINK. Check the **Max Cost** in the
    Subscription Manager to view the minimum subscription balance for all your contracts. When your request is processed, the actual cost of the request is calculated and deducted from your subscription balance. See [the next section](#estimate-vrf-request-cost) for an example of how to calculate the actual request cost.

    | Max verification gas | 200000   |
    | Premium percentage   | 24       |

    1. Calculate the total gas cost, using the maximum possible gas price for the selected gas lane, the estimated maximum verification gas, and the full callback gas limit:

       | Gas cost calculation                          | Total gas cost            |

    2. Apply the premium percentage to get the total maximum cost of a request:

       | Applying premium percentage                              | Maximum request cost (ETH) |
       | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
       | Total gas cost (ETH) \* ((100 + premium percentage)/100) |                            |
       | 0.15 ETH \* ((100 + 24)/100)                             | 0.186 ETH                  |

    For this example request to go through, you need to reserve a minimum subscription balance of 0.186 ETH, but that does not mean the actual request will cost 0.186 ETH. Check the **Max Cost** in the Subscription Manager to view the minimum subscription balance for all your contracts.

## Migration from VRF v2
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2

# Migrating from VRF v2
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2


<Vrf2_5Common callout="security" />

VRF V2.5 replaces both VRF V1 and VRF V2 on November 29, 2024. [Learn more about VRF V2.5](https://blog.chain.link/introducing-vrf-v2-5/).

## Benefits of VRF v2.5

Chainlink VRF v2.5 includes [all the same key benefits as VRF v2](https://blog.chain.link/vrf-v2-mainnet-launch/), along with the following additional benefits and changes:

- Easier upgrades to future versions by using the new `setCoordinator` function
- The option to pay for requests in either LINK or native tokens
- New, flexible request format in `requestRandomWords` to make any future upgrades easier

## Code changes

VRF v2.5 introduces a new request format and the `setCoordinator` function. See the [full migration walkthrough](#migration-walkthrough) or the code example for more details.

### New request format

The request format for VRF v2.5 has changed:

<TabsContent sharedStore="vrfMethod" client:visible>
  <Fragment slot="tab.1">Subscription</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Direct funding</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">
    The `requestRandomWords` function now uses `VRFV2PlusClient.RandomWordsRequest` with an object labeling each part of the request:


    ```solidity
    uint256 requestId = s_vrfCoordinator.requestRandomWords(
        VRFV2PlusClient.RandomWordsRequest({
            keyHash: keyHash,
            subId: s_vrfSubscriptionId,
            requestConfirmations: requestConfirmations,
            callbackGasLimit: callbackGasLimit,
            numWords: numWords,
            extraArgs: VRFV2PlusClient._argsToBytes(VRFV2PlusClient.ExtraArgsV1({nativePayment: true}))
        })
    );
    ```

    You must include a value for the new `extraArgs` key, which allows you to add extra arguments related to new VRF features. Use the `nativePayment` argument to enable or disable payment in native tokens.
  </Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    The `requestRandomness` function in the wrapper contract requires a new `extraArgs` argument that allows you to add extra arguments related to new VRF features. Use the `nativePayment` argument to enable or disable payment in native tokens.

    Additionally, the `requestRandomness` function now returns two arguments instead of one: the request ID and the request price.


    ```solidity
    bytes memory extraArgs = VRFV2PlusClient._argsToBytes(
        VRFV2PlusClient.ExtraArgsV1({nativePayment: false})
    );
    (uint256 reqId, uint256 reqPrice) = requestRandomness(
        callbackGasLimit,
        requestConfirmations,
        numWords,
        extraArgs
    );
    ```
  </Fragment>
</TabsContent>

### setCoordinator function

Add the `setCoordinator` function to your contract so that you can easily update the VRF coordinator for future VRF releases.

### Subscription ID type change

Note that the subscription ID has changed types from `uint64` in VRF V2 to `uint256` in VRF V2.5.

## Billing changes

You have the option to use either native tokens or LINK to pay for VRF requests. To accommodate this, the premium fee has changed from a flat LINK premium amount per request, to a percentage-based premium per request. Refer to the [Billing](/vrf/v2-5/billing) page for more details. To find out the new premium percentages for the networks you use, see the [Supported Networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.

For direct funding, the configurations for overhead gas have changed:

- The amount of wrapper overhead gas is reduced compared to V2.
- The amount of coordinator overhead gas used varies depending on the network used for your request, whether you're paying in LINK or native tokens, and how many random values you want in each VRF request. Refer to the [Billing](/vrf/v2-5/billing) page for more details and examples, and see the new configurations on the [Supported Networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.

## Migration walkthrough

VRF v2.5 currently supports subscriptions and direct funding on all [supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks). To migrate, you need to [update your existing smart contract code](#update-your-code) and redeploy your contracts.

If using subscriptions, [create and fund a new VRF v2.5 subscription](/vrf/v2-5/subscription/create-manage).

For direct funding, deploy the [`DirectFundingConsumer`](/samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol) example:

[Open DirectFundingConsumer.sol in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/DirectFundingConsumer.sol)

### Update your code

To modify your existing smart contract code to work with VRF v2.5, complete the following changes:

  <Fragment slot="tab.1">Subscription</Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="tab.2">Direct funding</Fragment>

  <Fragment slot="panel.1">

    2. Import the VRF v2.5 coordinator, [`VRFCoordinatorV2_5`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFCoordinatorV2_5.sol), and update any old references to the VRF V2 coordinator in your contract.

    3. Add a `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` constructor, passing in the VRF coordinator address for the network you're using.

    4. Update your `requestRandomWords` function calls to reflect the new request structure for VRF v2.5. Make sure to include the new `extraArgs` part of the `VRFV2PlusClient.RandomWordsRequest` object, and specify whether or not you want to pay for VRF requests using native tokens:

       </Tabs>

    5. When using the [`@chainlink/contracts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts/v/1.1.1) package version 1.1.1 and later, update your `fulfillRandomWords` function signature to match the `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus` contract, which has changed to:

       ```
       function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] calldata randomWords)
       ```

       In the `@chainlink/contracts` package version 1.1.0 and earlier, the `randomWords` parameter has a `memory` storage location.

  <Fragment slot="panel.2">
    1. Import the [`VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase.sol) contract and remove the v2 `VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase` import.

    2. Add a `VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerBase` constructor, passing in the VRF wrapper address for the network you're using. Unlike in V2, you don't have to pass the LINK token address to the constructor.

    3. If you're paying for requests with LINK, you can still call the `requestRandomness` function. However, if you're paying with native tokens, call the `requestRandomnessPayInNative` function instead.

       Both functions require one additional parameter, `extraArgs`. Use `nativePayment` to specify whether or not you want to pay for VRF requests using native tokens:

           );
           ```
         </Fragment>
       </Tabs>

    4. The V2.5 `requestRandomness` and `requestRandomnessPayInNative` functions both return a tuple: `(uint256 requestId, uint256 requestPrice)`. Adjust your `requestRandomWords` function or any other functions in your code where you call the V2.5 wrapper's `requestRandomness` or `requestRandomnessPayInNative` functions.

    5. Make sure your contract has a withdraw function for both native tokens and LINK. Both are included in the [direct funding example code](#direct-funding-example-code) and the [`VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerExample`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/testhelpers/VRFV2PlusWrapperConsumerExample.sol) contract.

# Subscription Method
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription


<Vrf2_5Common callout="security" />

This section explains how to generate random numbers using the subscription method.

> **NOTE: Migrate to V2.5**
>
> Follow the [migration guide](/vrf/v2-5/migration-from-v2) to learn how VRF has changed in V2.5 and to get example
> code.

## Subscriptions

VRF v2.5 requests receive funding from subscription accounts. Creating a VRF subscription lets you create an account and pre-pay for VRF v2.5, so you don't provide funding each time your application requests randomness. This reduces the total gas cost to use VRF v2.5. It also provides a simple way to fund your use of Chainlink products from a single location, so you don't have to manage multiple wallets across several different systems and applications.

Subscriptions have the following core concepts:

- **Subscription id:** 256-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the subscription.
- **Subscription accounts:** An account that holds LINK and native tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink VRF v2.5 coordinators.
- **Subscription owner:** The wallet address that creates and manages a subscription account. Any account can add LINK or native tokens to the subscription balance, but only the owner can add approved consuming contracts or withdraw funds.
- **Consumers:** Consuming contracts that are approved to use funding from your subscription account.
- **Subscription balance:** The amount of funds in LINK or native tokens maintained on your subscription account. Your subscription can maintain balances for both LINK and native tokens. Requests from consuming contracts will continue to be funded until the balance runs out, so be sure to maintain sufficient funds in your subscription balance to pay for the requests and keep your applications running.

For Chainlink VRF v2.5 to fulfill your requests, you must maintain a sufficient amount of LINK or native tokens in your subscription balance. Gas cost calculation includes the following variables:

- **Gas price:** The current gas price, which fluctuates depending on network conditions.

- **Callback gas:** The amount of gas used for the callback request that returns your requested random values.

- **Verification gas:** The amount of gas used to verify randomness onchain.

The gas price depends on current network conditions. The callback gas depends on your callback function, and the number of random values in your request. The cost of each request is final only after the transaction is complete, but you define the limits you are willing to spend for the request with the following variables:

- **Gas lane:** The maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei. Define this limit by specifying the appropriate `keyHash` in your request. The limits of each gas lane are important for handling gas price spikes when Chainlink VRF bumps the gas price to fulfill your request quickly.

- **Callback gas limit:** Specifies the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on the callback request. Define this limit by specifying the `callbackGasLimit` value in your request.

## Request and receive data

Requests to Chainlink VRF v2.5 follow the request and receive data cycle similarly to VRF V2. This end-to-end diagram shows each step in the lifecycle of a VRF subscription request, and registering a smart contract with a VRF subscription account:

(Image: Image)

VRF v2.5 uses both offchain and onchain components:

- [VRF v2.5 Coordinator (onchain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFCoordinatorV2_5.sol): A contract designed to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is made, and then verifies the random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
- VRF service (offchain component): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the `VRFCoordinator` including the random number and a proof of how it was generated.

### Account types used in VRF

Two types of accounts exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, and both are used in VRF:

- Externally Owned Account (EOA): An externally owned account that has a private key and can control a smart contract. Transactions can only be initiated by EOAs.
- Smart contract: A contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed for as a decentralized application.

While only EOAs can initiate transactions, do **not** attempt to use EOAs to send VRF requests directly. Instead, your EOA should interact with your consuming contract: the smart contract that is consuming the random values you request from VRF. Your EOA initiates the transaction, and then your consuming contract sends the VRF request.

### Set up your contract and request

Set up your consuming contract:

1. Your contract must inherit [VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol).

2. Your contract must implement the `fulfillRandomWords` function, which is the *callback VRF function*. Here, you add logic to handle the random values after they are returned to your contract.

3. Submit your VRF request by calling `requestRandomWords` of the [VRF Coordinator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFCoordinatorV2_5.sol). Include the following parameters in your request:
   - `keyHash`: Identifier that maps to a job and a private key on the VRF service and that represents a specified gas lane. If your request is urgent, specify a gas lane with a higher gas price limit. The configuration for your network can be found [here](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks).
   - `s_subscriptionId`: The subscription ID that the consuming contract is registered to. LINK funds are deducted from this subscription.
   - `requestConfirmations`: The number of block confirmations the VRF service will wait to respond. The minimum and maximum confirmations for your network can be found [here](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks).
   - `callbackGasLimit`: The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to pay for completing the callback VRF function. Note that you cannot put a value larger than `maxGasLimit` of the VRF Coordinator contract (read [coordinator contract limits](#limits) for more details).
   - `numWords`: The number of random numbers to request. The maximum random values that can be requested for your network can be found [here](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks).

In VRF 2.5, the request format has changed:

```solidity
uint256 requestID = s_vrfCoordinator.requestRandomWords(VRFV2PlusClient.RandomWordsRequest({
    keyHash: keyHash,
    subId: subId,
    requestConfirmations: requestConfirmations,
    callbackGasLimit: callbackGasLimit,
    numWords: numWords,
    extraArgs: VRFV2PlusClient._argsToBytes(VRFV2PlusClient.ExtraArgsV1({nativePayment: true})) // new parameter
  })
);
```

1. Add the `setCoordinator` method to your contract. This makes it easier to update your contract for future VRF releases by setting the new coordinator.

### How VRF processes your request

After you submit your request, it is processed using the [Request & Receive Data](#request-and-receive-data) cycle. The VRF coordinator processes the request and determines the final charge to your subscription using the following steps:

1. The VRF coordinator emits an event.

2. The VRF service picks up the event and waits for the specified number of block confirmations to respond back to the VRF coordinator with the random values and a proof (`requestConfirmations`).

3. The VRF coordinator verifies the proof onchain, then it calls back the consuming contract `fulfillRandomWords` function.

## Limits

Chainlink VRF v2.5 has [subscription limits](#subscription-limits) and [coordinator contract limits](#coordinator-contract-limits).

### Subscription limits

Subscriptions are required to maintain a minimum balance, and they can support a limited number of consuming contracts.

#### Minimum subscription balance

Each subscription must maintain a minimum balance to fund requests from consuming contracts. This minimum balance requirement serves as a buffer against gas volatility by ensuring that all your requests have more than enough funding to go through. If your balance is below the minimum, your requests remain pending for up to 24 hours before they expire. After you add sufficient LINK or native tokens to a subscription, pending requests automatically process as long as they have not expired.

In the Subscription Manager, the minimum subscription balance is displayed as the **Max Cost**, and it indicates the amount of LINK or native tokens you need to add for a pending request to process. After the request is processed, only the amount actually consumed by the request is deducted from your balance. For example, if you are paying for your VRF requests in LINK and your minimum balance is 10 LINK, but your subscription balance is 5 LINK, you need to add at least 5 more LINK for your request to process. This does not mean that your request will ultimately cost 10 LINK. If the request ultimately costs 3 LINK after it has processed, then 3 LINK is deducted from your subscription balance. The same concept applies if you are paying in native tokens.

The minimum subscription balance must be sufficient for each new consuming contract that you add to a subscription. For example, the minimum balance for a subscription that supports 20 consuming contracts needs to cover all the requests for all 20 contracts, while a subscription with one consuming contract only needs to cover that one contract.

For one request, the required size of the minimum balance depends on the gas lane and the size of the request. For example, a consuming contract that requests one random value will require a smaller minimum balance than a consuming contract that requests 50 random values. In general, you can estimate the required minimum balance using the following formula where max verification gas is always 200,000 gwei.

The following formulas show how the minimum subscription balance is calculated for LINK and native tokens in general. [Specific examples of each](/vrf/v2-5/billing#estimate-minimum-subscription-balance) are available on the Billing page, where you can compare the higher minimum subscription balance with the lower amount for an actual request.

    ```

    Here is the same formula, broken out into steps:

    ```
    Gas lane maximum * (Max verification gas + Callback gas limit) = Total estimated gas (Gwei)
    Total estimated gas (Gwei) * ((100 + premium %)/100) = Total estimated gas with premium (Gwei)

    ```

    Here is the same formula, broken out into steps:

    ```
    Gas lane maximum * (Max verification gas + Callback gas limit) = Total estimated gas (Gwei)
    Total estimated gas (Gwei) * ((100 + premium %)/100) = Total estimated gas with premium (Gwei)
    Total estimated gas with premium (Gwei) / 1,000,000,000 Gwei/ETH = Total estimated gas with premium (ETH)
    Total estimated gas with premium (ETH) / (ETH/[Native token] price) = Total estimated gas with premium (Native token)
    ```
  </Fragment>
</TabsContent>

#### Maximum consuming contracts

Each subscription supports up to 100 consuming contracts. If you need more than 100 consuming contracts, create multiple subscriptions.

### Coordinator contract limits

You can see the configuration for each network on the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page. You can also view the full configuration for each coordinator contract directly in the block explorer for that network, for example, Etherscan or Polygonscan.

- Each coordinator has a `MAX_NUM_WORDS` parameter that limits the maximum number of random values you can receive in each request.
- Each coordinator has a `maxGasLimit` parameter, which is the maximum allowed `callbackGasLimit` value for your requests. You must specify a sufficient `callbackGasLimit` to fund the callback request to your consuming contract. This depends on the number of random values you request and how you process them in your `fulfillRandomWords()` function. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback fails but your subscription is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.

# Create and manage VRF V2.5 subscriptions
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/subscription/create-manage


<Vrf2_5Common callout="security" />

## Using the VRF Subscription Manager

The [VRF Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/) is available to help you create and manage VRF V2.5 subscriptions. You can create and manage new V2.5 subscriptions, and manage existing V2 subscriptions, but you can no longer create new V2 subscriptions in the VRF Subscription Manager. Alternatively, you can [create and manage subscriptions programmatically](#create-a-subscription-programmatically).

### Create a subscription

To create a VRF 2.5 subscription:

1. Use the VRF Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/). Connect your wallet in the upper right corner and then click **Create subscription**. The address of your connected wallet is automatically filled in the **Admin** address field.

2. When the subscription is successfully created, there will be an alert in the upper right corner telling you that the subscription was successfully created. Click **Home** to navigate back to your main dashboard.

3. Your new subscription shows in the **My Subscriptions** list, along with any previous V2 subscriptions you might have. Click the Subscription ID for your new subscription in the list.

### Add a consumer

To add a consuming contract:

1. On the details page for your subscription, select **Add Consumer**.

2. Provide the address of your consuming contract, and then select **Add Consumer** again. Confirm the resulting prompts in MetaMask or other wallet browser extension.

### Fund your subscription

To fund your subscription:

1. On the page for your subscription, select the **Actions** menu and then select **Fund subscription**.

2. Your subscription has two balances: one for LINK, and one for the native token. Expand the **Asset** menu to select either LINK or the native token.

3. In **Amount to fund**, enter the amount you want to fund your subscription. Your wallet balance is displayed below the **Asset** field for easier reference. Select **Confirm** to fund your wallet, and then confirm the resulting prompts in MetaMask or other wallet browser extension.

### Cancel your subscription and withdraw funds

To withdraw your funds from a subscription, you must cancel the subscription.

1. Open the Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

2. On your subscription details page, expand the **Actions** menu and select **Cancel subscription**. A field displays, prompting you to add the wallet address you want to send the remaining funds to.

3. Enter your wallet address and click **Cancel subscription**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF closes your subscription account and sends the remaining LINK to your wallet.

If your subscription's admin address is a contract instead of an EOA, you may not be able to cancel the subscription directly. In this case, you must transfer ownership of your subscription to an EOA so that you can cancel the subscription and withdraw your funds.

## Create a subscription programmatically

If you prefer to create, fund and manage your subscriptions programmatically, you can either deploy a subscription manager contract or use your network's block explorer:

1. Create a new subscription for VRF v2.5:

# Get a Random Number
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/subscription/get-a-random-number


This guide explains how to get random values using a simple contract to request and receive random values from Chainlink VRF v2.5. The guide uses the Subscription Manager to create and manage your subscription. Alternatively, you can also [create and manage subscriptions programmatically](/vrf/v2-5/subscription/create-manage#create-a-subscription-programmatically). To explore more applications of VRF, refer to our [blog](https://blog.chain.link/).

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum testnets using the following tools:

- [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Sepolia testnet ETH](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet)

If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting Started](/getting-started/conceptual-overview) guide to learn the basics.

## Create and fund a subscription

For this example, create a new subscription on the Sepolia testnet.

1. Open MetaMask and set it to use the Sepolia testnet. The [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) detects your network based on the active network in MetaMask.

2. Check MetaMask to make sure you have testnet ETH and LINK on Sepolia. You can get testnet ETH and LINK at [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia/).

3. Open the Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

   <div class="remix-callout">
     <a href="https://vrf.chain.link">Open the Subscription Manager</a>
   </div>

4. Click **Create Subscription** and follow the instructions to create a new subscription account. If you connect your wallet to the Subscription Manager, the **Admin address** for your subscription is prefilled and not editable. Optionally, you can enter an email address and a project name for your subscription, and both of these are private. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment to create the account onchain. After you approve the transaction, the network confirms the creation of your subscription account onchain.

5. After the subscription is created, click **Add funds** and follow the instructions to fund your subscription.

   For your request to go through, you need to fund your subscription with enough testnet funds to meet your [minimum subscription balance](/vrf/v2-5/overview/subscription#minimum-subscription-balance) to serve as a buffer against gas volatility.

   - If you're paying with testnet LINK, fund your contract with 7 LINK. (After your request is processed, the actual cost will be around 0.06 LINK, and that amount will be deducted from your subscription balance.)
   - If you're paying with testnet ETH, fund your contract with 0.03 ETH. (After your request is processed, the actual cost will be around 0.000247 ETH, and that amount will be deducted from your subscription balance.)

   MetaMask opens to confirm the token transfer to your subscription. After you approve the transaction, the network confirms the transfer of your testnet funds to your subscription account.

6. After you add funds, click **Add consumer**. A page opens with your account details and subscription ID.

7. Record your subscription ID, which you need for your consuming contract. You will add the consuming contract to your subscription later.

You can always find your subscription IDs, balances, and consumers at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/).

Now that you have a funded subscription account and your subscription ID, [create and deploy a VRF compatible contract](#create-and-deploy-a-vrf-compatible-contract).

## Create and deploy a VRF compatible contract

For this example, use the [SubscriptionConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/SubscriptionConsumer.sol) sample contract. This contract imports the following dependencies:

- `VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/VRFConsumerBaseV2Plus.sol)
- `VRFV2PlusClient.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/dev/libraries/VRFV2PlusClient.sol)

The contract also includes pre-configured values for the necessary request parameters such as `vrfCoordinator` address, gas lane `keyHash`, `callbackGasLimit`, `requestConfirmations` and number of random words `numWords`. You can change these parameters if you want to experiment on different testnets, but for this example you only need to specify `subscriptionId` when you deploy the contract.

Build and deploy the contract on Sepolia.

1. Open the [SubscriptionConsumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/v2-5/SubscriptionConsumer.sol) in Remix.

   <CodeSample src="samples/VRF/v2-5/SubscriptionConsumer.sol" showButtonOnly />

2. On the **Compile** tab in Remix, compile the `SubscriptionConsumer.sol` contract.

3. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Provider** environment, select the `SubscriptionConsumer` contract from the contract list, and specify your `subscriptionId` so the constructor can set it.

   (Image: Example showing the deploy button with the subscriptionID field filled in Remix)

4. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract onchain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

5. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2.5, you must add this address as an approved consuming contract on your subscription account.

   (Image: Example showing the contract address listed under the Contracts list in Remix)

6. Open the Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

7. Under the **Consumers** section, click **Add consumer**.

8. Enter the address of your consuming contract that you just deployed and click **Add consumer**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

Your example contract is deployed and approved to use your subscription balance to pay for VRF v2.5 requests. Next, [request random values](#request-random-values) from Chainlink VRF.

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives those values, builds a struct `RequestStatus` containing them and stores the struct in a mapping `s_requests`. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on your contract to start the request.

1. Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

2. Expand the `requestRandomWords()` function to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. Use `enableNativePayment` to specify whether you want to pay in native tokens or LINK:

   - To use native tokens, set `enableNativePayment` to `true`.
   - To use LINK, set `enableNativePayment` to `false`.

   When you click **transact**, MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request. Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function. At this point, a new key `requestId` is added to the mapping `s_requests`.

   Depending on current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the callback to return the requested random values to your contract. You can see a list of pending requests for your subscription ID at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/).

3. To fetch the request ID of your request, call `lastRequestId()`.

4. After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping `s_requests` is updated: The received random values are stored in `s_requests[_requestId].randomWords`.

5. Call `getRequestStatus()` specifying the `requestId` to display the random words.

You deployed a simple contract that can request and receive random values from Chainlink VRF. Next, learn how to [create and manage subscriptions programmatically](/vrf/v2-5/subscription/create-manage#create-a-subscription-programmatically) by using a smart contract instead of the Subscription Manager.

> **NOTE: Note on Requesting Randomness**
>
> Do not allow re-requesting or cancellation of randomness. For more information, see the [VRF Security
> Considerations](/vrf/v2-5/security#do-not-allow-re-requesting-or-cancellation-of-randomness) page.

## Analyzing the contract

In this example, your MetaMask wallet is the subscription owner and you created a consuming contract to use that subscription. The consuming contract uses static configuration parameters.

    require(s_requests[_requestId].exists, "request not found");
    RequestStatus memory request = s_requests[_requestId];
    return (request.fulfilled, request.randomWords);
  }
}
```

The parameters define how your requests will be processed. You can find the values for your network in the [Configuration](/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks) page.

- `uint256 s_subscriptionId`: The subscription ID that this contract uses for funding requests.

- `bytes32 keyHash`: The gas lane key hash value, which is the maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei. It functions as an ID of the offchain VRF job that runs in response to requests.

- `uint32 callbackGasLimit`: The limit for how much gas to use for the callback request to your contract's `fulfillRandomWords()` function. It must be less than the `maxGasLimit` limit on the coordinator contract. Adjust this value for larger requests depending on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback will fail and your subscription is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.

- `uint16 requestConfirmations`: How many confirmations the Chainlink node should wait before responding. The longer the node waits, the more secure the random value is. It must be greater than the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` limit on the coordinator contract.

- `uint32 numWords`: How many random values to request. If you can use several random values in a single callback, you can reduce the amount of gas that you spend per random value. The total cost of the callback request depends on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values, so adjust your `callbackGasLimit` accordingly.

The contract includes the following functions:

- `requestRandomWords(bool enableNativePayment)`: Takes your specified parameters and submits the request to the VRF coordinator contract. Use `enableNativePayment` to specify for each request whether you want to pay in native tokens or LINK:
  - To use native tokens, set `enableNativePayment` to `true`.
  - To use LINK, set `enableNativePayment` to `false`.

- `fulfillRandomWords()`: Receives random values and stores them with your contract.

- `getRequestStatus()`: Retrieve request details for a given `_requestId`.

> **NOTE: Security Considerations**
>
> Be sure to review your contracts to make sure they follow the best practices on the [security
> considerations](/vrf/v2-5/security) page.

## Clean up

After you are done with this contract and the subscription, you can retrieve the remaining testnet tokens to use with other examples.

1. Open the Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

2. On your subscription details page, expand the **Actions** menu and select **Cancel subscription**. A field displays, prompting you to add the wallet address you want to send the remaining funds to.

3. Enter your wallet address and click **Cancel subscription**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF closes your subscription account and sends the remaining LINK to your wallet.

# Supported Networks
Source: https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2-5/supported-networks


Chainlink VRF allows you to integrate provably fair and verifiably random data in your smart contract. For implementation details, read [Introduction to Chainlink VRF](/vrf).

VRF v2.5 coordinators for subscription funding are available on several networks. To use Chainlink VRF on certain networks, you may need to conduct token transfers. You can transfer tokens by using [Chainlink CCIP](/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract), [Transporter](https://www.transporter.io/) or third-party applications such as [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

> **NOTE: Interfaces and Applications**

## Coordinator parameters

These parameters are configured in the coordinator contract. You can view these values by running `getConfig` on the coordinator or by viewing the coordinator contracts in a blockchain explorer.

- `uint16 minimumRequestConfirmations`: The minimum number of confirmation blocks on VRF requests before oracles respond
- `uint32 maxGasLimit`: The maximum gas limit supported for a `fulfillRandomWords` callback.
- `uint32 stalenessSeconds`: How long the coordinator waits until we consider the ETH/LINK price used for converting gas costs to LINK is stale and use `fallbackWeiPerUnitLink`
- `uint32 gasAfterPaymentCalculation`: How much gas is used outside of the payment calculation. This covers the additional operations required to decrement the subscription balance and increment the balance for the oracle that handled the request.

The LINK provided by the [BNB Chain Bridge](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/bridge) is not ERC-677 compatible, so cannot
be used with Chainlink oracles. However, it can be [**converted to the official LINK token on BNB Chain using Chainlink's PegSwap service**](https://pegswap.chain.link/).

### Polygon Mainnet

The LINK provided by the [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge) is not ERC-677 compatible,
so cannot be used with Chainlink oracles. However, it can be [**converted to the official LINK token on Polygon using
Chainlink's PegSwap service**](https://pegswap.chain.link/)

# Decentralized Data Model
Source: https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model


This page describes how data aggregation is applied to produce Chainlink Data Feeds and provides more insight as to how Data Feeds are updated.

## Data aggregation

Each data feed is updated by multiple, independent Chainlink oracle operators. The [AccessControlledOffchainAggregator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol) aggregates the data onchain.

Offchain Reporting (OCR) further enhances the aggregation process. To learn more about OCR and how it works, see the [Offchain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.

## Shared data resource

Each data feed is built and funded by the community of users who rely on accurate, up-to-date data in their smart contracts. As more users rely on and contribute to a data feed, the quality of the data feed improves. For this reason, each data feed has its own properties depending on the needs of its community of users.

## Decentralized Oracle Network

Each data feed is updated by a decentralized oracle network. Each oracle operator is rewarded for publishing data. The number of oracles contributing to each feed varies. In order for an update to take place, the data feed aggregator contract must receive responses from a minimum number of oracles or the latest answer will not be updated. You can see the minimum number of oracles for the corresponding feed at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link).

Each oracle in the set publishes data during an aggregation round. That data is validated and aggregated by a smart contract, which forms the feed's latest and trusted answer.

## Components of a Decentralized Oracle Network

Data Feeds are an example of a decentralized oracle network, and include the following components:

- [A consumer contract](#consumer)
- [A proxy contract](#proxy)
- [An aggregator contract](#aggregator)

To learn how to create a consumer contract that uses an existing data feed, read the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) documentation.

### Consumer

A Consumer contract is any contract that uses Chainlink Data Feeds to consume aggregated data. Consumer contracts must reference the correct [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) contract and call one of the exposed functions.

```solidity
...
AggregatorV3Interface feed = AggregatorV3Interface(address);
return feed.latestRoundData();
```

Offchain applications can also consume data feeds. See the Javascript and Python example code on the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) page to learn more.

### Proxy

Proxy contracts are onchain proxies that point to the aggregator for a particular data feed. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be upgraded without any service interruption to consuming contracts.

Proxy contracts can vary from one data feed to another, but the [`EACAggregatorProxy.sol` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.0.0/contracts/src/v0.6/EACAggregatorProxy.sol) on Github is a common example.

### Aggregator

An aggregator is the contract that receives periodic data updates from the oracle network. Aggregators store aggregated data onchain so that consumers can retrieve it and act upon it within the same transaction.

You can access this data using the Data Feed address and the [`AggregatorV3Interface` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol).

Aggregators receive updates from the oracle network only when the **Deviation Threshold** or **Heartbeat Threshold** triggers an update during an aggregation round. The first condition that is met triggers an update to the data.

- Deviation Threshold: A new aggregation round starts when a node identifies that the off-chain values deviate by more than the defined deviation threshold from the onchain value. Individual nodes monitor one or more data providers for each feed.
- Heartbeat Threshold: A new aggregation round starts after a specified amount of time from the last update.

## Basic request model

Chainlink connects smart contracts with external data using its decentralized oracle network. Chainlink API requests are handled 1:1 by an oracle.

The [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model) describes the onchain architecture of requesting data from a single oracle source.

To learn how to make a GET request using a single oracle, see [Make a GET Request](/any-api/get-request/introduction).

## Decentralized data model

For a more robust and trustworthy answer, you can aggregate data from many oracles. With onchain aggregation, data is aggregated from a decentralized network of independent oracle nodes. This architecture is applied to Chainlink Data Feeds, which can aggregate data such as asset price data.

The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model) describes how data is aggregated, and how consumer contracts can retrieve this data.

## Offchain reporting

Offchain Reporting (OCR) is an improvement on the decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. With our Offchain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its price observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

To learn more about OCR and how it works, see the [Offchain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.

### ChainlinkClient

[`ChainlinkClient`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ChainlinkClient.sol) is a parent contract that enables smart contracts to consume data from oracles. It's available in the Chainlink smart contract library which can be [installed using the latest package managers](/resources/create-a-chainlinked-project).

The client constructs and makes a request to a known Chainlink oracle through the `transferAndCall` function, implemented by the LINK token. This request contains encoded information that is required for the cycle to succeed. In the `ChainlinkClient` contract, this call is initiated with a call to `sendChainlinkRequestTo`.

To build your own client contract using `ChainlinkClient`, see [Introduction to Using Any API](/any-api/introduction), or view the [ChainlinkClient API Reference](/any-api/api-reference) for the `ChainlinkClient` contract.

### LINK Token

LINK is an [ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677) compliant token which implements `transferAndCall`, a function that allows tokens to be transferred whilst also triggering logic in the receiving contract within a single transaction.

Learn more about [ERC-677 and the LINK token](/resources/link-token-contracts).

### Operator Contract

[`Operator` contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) are owned by oracle node operators, which run alongside offchain oracle nodes.

#### Request

The client contract that initiates this cycle must create a request with the following items:

- The oracle address.
- The job ID, so the oracle knows which tasks to perform.
- The callback function, which the oracle sends the response to.

To learn about how to find oracles to suit your needs, see [Find Existing Jobs](/any-api/find-oracle).

Operator contracts are responsible for handling onchain requests made through the LINK token, by implementing `onTokenTransfer` as a <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/LinkTokenReceiver.sol">`LinkTokenReceiver`</a>. Upon execution of this function, the operator contract **emits an `OracleRequest` event** containing information about the request. This event is crucial, as it is monitored by the offchain oracle node which acts upon it.

#### Fulfillment

For fulfillment, the operator contract has a `fulfillOracleRequest` function which is used by the node to fulfill a request once it has the result of the job. This function returns the result to the `ChainlinkClient` using the callback function defined in the original request.

### Offchain oracle node

The offchain oracle node is responsible for listening for events emitted by its corresponding onchain smart contract. Once it detects an `OracleRequest` event, it uses the data emitted to perform a job.

The most common job type for a Node is to make a GET request to an API, retrieve some data from it, parse the response, convert the result into blockchain compatible data, then submit it in a transaction back to the operator contract, using the `fulfillOracleRequest` function.

For more information on how to become a node operator, learn how to [run a Chainlink node](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node).

# Offchain Reporting
Source: https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting


Offchain Reporting (OCR) is a significant step towards increasing the decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. See the [OCR Protocol Paper](https://research.chain.link/ocr3.pdf) for a technical deep dive.

For Offchain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its data observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

The report contained in the aggregate transaction is signed by a quorum of oracles and contains all oracles' observations. By validating the report onchain and checking the quorum's signatures onchain, we preserve the trustlessness properties of Chainlink oracle networks.

## What is OCR?

> **NOTE: A simple analogy**
>
> Imagine ordering 10 items from an online store. Each item is packaged separately and posted separately, meaning
> postage and packaging costs must be applied to each one, and the carrier has to transport 10 different boxes.

OCR, on the other hand, packages all of these items into a single box and posts that. This saves postage and packaging
fees and all effort the carrier associates with transporting 9 fewer boxes.

The OCR protocol allows nodes to aggregate their observations into a single report offchain using a secure P2P network. A single node then submits a transaction with the aggregated report to the chain. Each report consists of many nodes' observations and has to be signed by a quorum of nodes. These signatures are verified onchain.

Submitting only one transaction per round achieves the following benefits:

- Overall network congestion from Chainlink oracle networks is reduced dramatically
- Individual node operators spend far less on gas costs
- Node networks are more scalable because data feeds can accommodate more nodes
- Data feeds can be updated in a more timely manner since each round needn't wait for multiple transactions to be confirmed before a price is confirmed onchain.

## How does OCR work?

Protocol execution happens mostly offchain over a peer to peer network between Chainlink nodes. The nodes regularly elect a new leader node that drives the rest of the protocol.

The leader regularly requests followers to provide freshly signed observations and aggregates them into a report. It then sends this report back to the followers and asks them to verify the report's validity. If a quorum of followers approves the report by sending a signed copy back to the leader, the leader assembles a final report with the quorum's signatures and broadcasts it to all followers.

The nodes attempt to transmit the final report to the aggregator contract according to a randomized schedule. The aggregator verifies that a quorum of nodes signed the report and exposes the median value to consumers as an answer with a block timestamp and a round ID.

All nodes watch the blockchain for the final report to remove any single point of failure during transmission. If the designated node fails to get their transmission confirmed within a determined period, a round-robin protocol kicks in so other nodes can also transmit the final report until one of them is confirmed.

## Configuring Chainlink Nodes

# Configuring Nodes
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/configuring-nodes


Starting with Chainlink v2.0.0, TOML configuration is the only supported configuration method. You can switch to TOML format using the [Chainlink v1.13.0 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags). After your Chainlink node is running stable on v1.13.0, you can continue to use the TOML config on future images where support for `.env` configs are no longer supported.

You can see the available config options on the [Node Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config) and [Node Secrets](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config) pages.

## Migrating from environment variables to TOML

Before you begin, update your Chainlink Node to v1.13.0 and ensure that it operates as expected. This is the last version that supports environment variable configuration, and the best version to use for TOML migration before you update the node to future versions.

### Export your current config

You can generate the `config.toml` file using the `chainlink config dump` command. This guide shows you how to do this for a Chainlink node running in a Docker container:

1. Open an interactive shell inside the Docker container that runs your node:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it chainlink bash
   ```

2. Log in to the Chainlink CLI with an account that has admin access:

   ```shell
   chainlink admin login
   ```

3. Export the current config to a `config.toml` file:

   ```shell
   chainlink config dump > config.toml
   ```

4. Log out of the Chainlink CLI and close the shell on the Docker container.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin logout && exit
   ```

5. Change to the directory where your .env file is located. This is the directory that you mount to Docker when you run the node. You will create your `config.toml` and `secrets.toml` files here so Docker can provide them to your node container.

   ```shell
   cd ~/.chainlink
   ```

6. Write the config file from the container to your host:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it chainlink cat /home/chainlink/config.toml > ./config.toml
   ```

7. Create a `secrets.toml` file with the minimum required secrets, which are `[Database]` and `[Password]`.

   If you are working on a test node, you can use `?sslmode=disable` in the database `URL`. You might also need [`AllowSimplePasswords = true`](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config#allowsimplepasswords) in the `[Database]` section so you can start the node, but you should make the database password sufficiently complex as a best practice:

   ```shell
   echo "[Database]
   URL = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname'

   [Password]
   Keystore = 'keystore_pass'" > ./secrets.toml
   ```

8. Edit the `secrets.toml` file to include the secrets you need for your specific Chainlink node. See the [Node Secrets](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config) page for a full list of available options.

### Validate the configuration

After you have the `config.toml` file and the `secrets.toml` files on the host system, you can validate these files using a temporary Docker container.

1. Validate the configuration by running the `config validate` command in the Docker container. This command changes to `node validate` when you upgrade your node to version `2.0.0` or later.

   ```shell
   docker run --platform linux/x86_64/v8 --name chainlink-config-validator -v ~/.chainlink:/chainlink -it --rm smartcontract/chainlink:1.13.0 -config /chainlink/config.toml -secrets /chainlink/secrets.toml config validate
   ```

   You will likely see some invalid config errors. For example:

   ```shell
   Invalid configuration: EVM.3.Nodes: missing: must have at least one node
   ```

2. Edit the `config.toml` and `secrets.toml` files to manually correct any errors. See the [Node Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config) and [Node Secrets](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config) pages to learn which settings are valid. For the error in this example, an EVM chain was configured with no nodes. Removing this from the config made the config valid:

   ```
   [[EVM]]
   ChainID = '421613'
   Enabled = false
   Nodes = []
   ```

3. Run the `config validate` command again and make additional changes until you have a valid config message:

   ```shell
   Valid configuration.
   ```

### Restart your Chainlink node using the TOML config

With your valid config and secrets files, you can migrate your Chainlink node to use the new config.

1. Stop your existing Chainlink node:

   ```shell
   docker stop chainlink
   ```

2. Make a Postgres [database snapshot](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup-dump.html) so you can restore your previous Chainlink node if necessary.

3. Start a new Chainlink node Docker container named using the new `config.toml` and `secrets.toml` files. This example uses `chainlink-toml` as the container name:

   ```shell
   docker run --platform linux/x86_64/v8 --name chainlink-toml  -v ~/.chainlink:/chainlink -it -p 6688:6688 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway smartcontract/chainlink:1.13.0 -config /chainlink/config.toml -secrets /chainlink/secrets.toml node start
   ```

Test your node to verify that it works as intended. If you are using a VPS, open an [SSH tunnel](https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/) using `ssh -i $KEY $USER@$REMOTE-IP -L 6688:localhost:6688 -N`. Connect to the Operator UI in your browser at `localhost:6688`.

## Using multiple config files

You can use multiple config and secrets files. The config settings from each file are applied in the order that you specify when you run your node. Duplicated fields override values specified in earlier config files. This allows you to create a common config that applies to many nodes with specific configs for nodes that need unique configuration settings. Specifying multiple secrets files is invalid.

To specify multiple config files, add additional `-config` flags to the `docker run` command:

```shell
docker run --platform linux/x86_64/v8 --name chainlink -v ~/.chainlink:/chainlink -it -p 6688:6688 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway smartcontract/chainlink:1.13.0 -config /chainlink/config.toml -config /chainlink/config2.toml -config /chainlink/config3.toml -secrets /chainlink/secrets.toml node start
```

# Task Types
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks


This guide outlines different task types.

## 'Any' task

Returns a random value from the set of inputs passed in.

**Parameters**

None.

**Inputs**

Can be anything.

**Outputs**

A randomly-selected value from the set of inputs.

**Example**

```toml
fetch1   [type="http" ...]
fetch2   [type="http" ...]
fetch3   [type="http" ...]
pick_any [type="any"]

fetch1 -> pick_any
fetch2 -> pick_any
fetch3 -> pick_any
```

`pick_any` will return either the result of `fetch1`, `fetch2`, or `fetch3`.

## Base64 Decode task

Accepts a base64 encoded string and returns decoded bytes.

**Parameters**

- `input`: a base64 encoded string.

**Outputs**

Decoded bytes.

**Example**

```toml
my_base64decode_task [type="base64decode" input="SGVsbG8sIHBsYXlncm91bmQ="]
```

Given the input `SGVsbG8sIHBsYXlncm91bmQ=`, the task will return `Hello, playground` (as ASCII bytes).

## Base64 Encode task

Encodes bytes/string into a Base64 string.

**Parameters**

- `input`: Byte array or string to be encoded.

**Outputs**

String with Base64 encoding of input.

**Example**

```toml
my_base64encode_task [type="base64encode" input="Hello, playground"]
```

Given the input string "Hello, playground", the task will return "SGVsbG8sIHBsYXlncm91bmQ=".

## Bridge task

Bridge tasks make HTTP POST requests to pre-configured URLs. Bridges can be configured via the UI or the CLI, and are referred to by a simple user-specified name. This is the way that most jobs interact with [External Adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).

**Parameters**

- `name`: an arbitrary name given to the bridge by the node operator.
- `requestData` (optional): a statically-defined payload to be sent to the external adapter.
- `cacheTTL` (optional): a duration-formatted string indicating the maximum acceptable staleness for cached bridge responses in case of intermittent failures. This is disabled by default.
- `headers` (optional): an array of strings. The number of strings must be even. Example: `foo [type="bridge" name="foo" headers="[\\"X-Header-1\\", \\"value1\\", \\"X-Header-2\\", \\"value2\\"]"]`

**Outputs**

A string containing the response body.

**Example**

```toml
my_bridge_task [type="bridge"
                name="some_bridge"
                requestData="{\\"data\\":{\\"foo\\": $(foo), \\"bar\\": $(bar)}}"
                ]
```

## CBOR Parse task

CBOR Parse tasks parse a CBOR payload, typically as part of a Direct Request workflow. In Direct Request, a user makes an onchain request using a `ChainlinkClient` contract, which encodes the request parameters as CBOR. See below for an example.

**Parameters**

- `data`: A byte array containing the CBOR payload.
- `mode`: An optional parameter that specifies how to parse the incoming CBOR. The default mode is `diet`, which expects the input to be a map. Set the mode to `standard` to pass literal values through "as-is". Empty inputs return nil.

**Outputs**

A map containing the request parameters. Parameters can be individually accessed using `$(dot.accessors)`.

**Example**

```toml
// First, we parse the request log and the CBOR payload inside of it
decode_log  [type="ethabidecodelog"
             data="$(jobRun.logData)"
             topics="$(jobRun.logTopics)"
             abi="SomeContractEvent(bytes32 requestID, bytes cborPayload)"]

decode_cbor [type="cborparse"
             data="$(decode_log.cborPayload)"]

// Then, we use the decoded request parameters to make an HTTP fetch
fetch [type="http" url="$(decode_cbor.fetchURL)" method=GET]
parse [type="jsonparse" path="$(decode_cbor.jsonPath)" data="$(fetch)"]

// ... etc ...
```

See the [Direct Request page](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs/#direct-request-jobs) for a more comprehensive example.

## Divide task

Divides the provided `input` by the `divisor` and returns the result with a number of decimal places defined in the `precision` value.

**Parameters**

- `input`: The value to be divided
  - number
  - stringified number
  - bytes-ified number
  - `$(variable)`
- `divisor`: The value by which to divide the `input`
  - number
  - stringified number
  - bytes-ified number
  - `$(variable)`
- `precision`: The number of decimal places to retain in the result
  - number
  - stringified number
  - bytes-ified number
  - `$(variable)`

**Outputs**

The result of the division.

**Example**

```toml
my_divide_task [type="divide"
                input="$(json_parse_result)"
                divisor="3"
                precision="2"]
```

Given the input `10`, this example returns `3.33`.

## ETH ABI Decode Log task

Decodes a log emitted by an ETH contract.

**Parameters**

- `abi`: a canonical ETH log event definition. Should be formatted exactly as in Solidity. Each argument must be named. Examples:
  - `NewRound(uint256 indexed roundId, address indexed startedBy, uint256 startedAt)`
  - `AuthorizedSendersChanged(address[] senders)`
- `data`: the ABI-encoded log data. Can be:
  - a byte array
  - a hex-encoded string beginning with `0x`
  - ... but generally should just be set to `$(jobRun.logData)` (see the [Direct Request page](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs/#direct-request-jobs))
- `topics`: the ABI-encoded log topics (i.e., the `indexed` parameters)
  - an array of bytes32 values
  - an array of hex-encoded bytes32 values beginning with `0x`
  - ... but generally should just be set to `$(jobRun.logTopics)` (see the [Direct Request page](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs/#direct-request-jobs))

**Outputs**

A map containing the decoded values.

**Example**

```toml
decode [type="ethabidecodelog"
        abi="NewRound(uint256 indexed roundId, address indexed startedBy, uint256 startedAt)"
        data="$(jobRun.logData)"
        topics="$(jobRun.logTopics)"]
```

This task will return a map with the following schema:

```json
{
    "roundId": ...,   // a number
    "startedBy": ..., // an address
    "startedAt": ..., // a number
}
```

## ETH ABI Decode task

Decodes a ETH ABI-encoded payload, typically the result of an [ETH Call task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-call-task).

**Parameters**

- `abi`: a canonical ETH ABI argument string. Should be formatted exactly as in Solidity. Each argument must be named. Examples:
  - `uint256 foo, bytes32 bar, address[] baz`
  - `address a, uint80[3][] u, bytes b, bytes32 b32`
- `data`: the ABI-encoded payload to decode. Can be:

**Outputs**

A map containing the decoded values.

**Example**

```toml
decode [type="ethabidecode"
        abi="bytes32 requestID, uint256 price, address[] oracles"
        data="$(eth_call_result)"]
```

This task will return a map with the following schema:

```json
{
    "requestID": ..., // [32]byte value
    "price": ...,     // a number
    "oracles": [
        "0x859AAa51961284C94d970B47E82b8771942F1980",
        "0x51DE85B0cD5B3684865ECfEedfBAF12777cd0Ff8",
        ...
    ]
}
```

## ETH ABI Encode task

Encodes a bytes payload according to ETH ABI encoding, typically in order to perform an [ETH Call](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-call-task) or an [ETH Tx](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-tx-task).

**Parameters**

- `abi`: a canonical ETH ABI argument string. Should be formatted exactly as in Solidity. Each argument must be named. If a method name is provided, the 4-byte method signature is prepended to the result. Examples:
  - `uint256 foo, bytes32 bar, address[] baz`
  - `fulfillRequest(bytes32 requestID, uint256 answer)`
- `data`: a map of the values to be encoded. The task will make a best effort at converting values to the appropriate types.

**Outputs**

A byte array.

**Example**

```toml
encode [type="ethabiencode"
        abi="fulfillRequest(bytes32 requestID, uint256 answer)"
        data="{\\"requestID\\": $(foo), \\"answer\\": $(bar)}"
        ]
```

## ETH Call task

Makes a non-mutating contract call to the specified contract with the specified data payload.

**Parameters**

- `contract`: the address of the contract to call.
- `data`: the data to attach to the call (including the function selector).
- `gas`: the amount of gas to attach to the transaction.
- `from`: The from address with which the call should be made. Defaults to zero address.
- `gasPrice`: The gasPrice for the call. Defaults to zero.
- `gasTipCap`: The gasTipCap (EIP-1559) for the call. Defaults to zero.
- `gasFeeCap`: The gasFeeCap (EIP-1559) for the call. Defaults to zero.
- `gasUnlimited`: A boolean indicating if unlimited gas should be provided for the call. If set to true, do not pass the `gas` parameter.
- `evmChainID`: Set this optional parameter to transmit on the given chain. You must have the chain configured with RPC nodes for this to work. If left blank, it will use the default chain.

**Outputs**

An ABI-encoded byte array containing the return value of the contract function.

**Example**

```toml
encode_call  [type="ethabiencode"
              abi="checkUpkeep(bytes data)"
              data="{ \\"data\\": $(upkeep_data) }"]

call          [type="ethcall"
               contract="0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088"
               data="$(encode_call)"
               gas="1000"]

decode_result [type="ethabidecode"
               abi="bool upkeepNeeded, bytes performData"
               data="$(call)"]

encode_call -> call -> decode_result
```

## ETH Tx task

Makes a mutating transaction to the specified contract with the specified data payload. The transaction is guaranteed to succeed eventually.

**Parameters**

- `from`: one or more addresses of the externally-owned account from which to send the transaction. If left blank, it will select a random address on every send for the given chain ID.
- `to`: the address of the contract to make a transaction to.
- `data`: the data to attach to the call (including the function selector). Most likely, this will be the output of an `ethabiencode` task.
- `gasLimit`: the amount of gas to attach to the transaction.
- `txMeta`: a map of metadata that is saved into the database for debugging.
- `minConfirmations`: minimum number of confirmations required before this task will continue. Set to zero to continue immediately. Note that this does not affect transaction inclusion. All transactions will always be included in the chain up to the configured finality depth.
- `evmChainID`: set this optional parameter to transmit on the given chain. You must have the chain configured with RPC nodes for this to work. If left blank, it will use the default chain.
- `failOnRevert`: an optional parameter, a boolean, that allows a ChainLink node operator's UI to display and color the status of the task within a job's pipeline depending on a transaction status. *default*: false.

**Outputs**

The hash of the transaction attempt that eventually succeeds (after potentially going through a gas bumping process to ensure confirmation).

**Example**

```toml
encode_tx    [type="ethabiencode"
              abi="performUpkeep(bytes performData)"
              data="{ \\"data\\": $(upkeep_data) }"]

submit_tx    [type="ethtx"

               data="$(encode_tx)"
               failOnRevert="true"]

encode_tx -> submit_tx
```

## Hex Decode task

Accepts a hexadecimal encoded string and returns decoded bytes.

**Parameters**

- `input`: a hexadecimal encoded string, must have prefix `0x`.

my_hexdecode_task [type="hexdecode" input="0x12345678"]
```

Given the input `0x12345678`, the task will return `[0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78]`.

## Hex Encode task

Encodes bytes/string/integer into a hexadecimal string.

**Parameters**

- `input`: Byte array, string or integer to be encoded.

**Outputs**

Hexadecimal string prefixed with "0x" (or empty string if input was empty).

**Example**

```

Given the input string "xyz", the task will return "0x78797a", which are the ascii values of characters in the string.

## HTTP task

HTTP tasks make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Parameters**

- `method`: the HTTP method that the request should use.
- `url`: the URL to make the HTTP request to.
- `requestData` (optional): a statically-defined payload to be sent to the external adapter.
- `allowUnrestrictedNetworkAccess` (optional): permits the task to access a URL at `localhost`, which could present a security risk. Note that Bridge tasks allow this by default.
- `headers` (optional): an array of strings. The number of strings must be even. Example: `foo [type=http headers="[\\"X-Header-1\\", \\"value1\\", \\"X-Header-2\\", \\"value2\\"]"]`

**Outputs**

A string containing the response body.

**Example**

              requestData="{\\"foo\\": $(foo), \\"bar\\": $(bar), \\"jobID\\": 123}"
              allowUnrestrictedNetworkAccess=true
              ]
```

## JSON Parse task

JSON Parse tasks parse a JSON payload and extract a value at a given keypath.

**Parameters**

- `data`: the JSON string. Can be:
  - string
  - byte array
- `path`: the keypath to extract. Must be a comma-delimited list of keys, or specify a custom `separator` alternative.
- `separator`: (optional) custom `path` key separator. Defaults to comma (`,`).
- `lax` (optional): if false (or omitted), and the keypath doesn't exist, the task will error. If true, the task will return `nil` to the next task.

**Outputs**

The value at the provided keypath.

**Example**

```toml
my_json_task [type="jsonparse"
              data="$(http_fetch_result)"

              values=<[ $(fetch1), $(fetch2), $(fetch3) ]>
              precision=2
              allowedFaults=1]
```

Given the inputs `2`, `5`, and `20`, the task will return `9`.

## Median task

Accepts multiple numerical inputs and returns the median of them.

**Parameters**

- `values`: an array of values from which to select a median.
- `allowedFaults` (optional): the maximum number of input tasks that can error without the Median task erroring. If not specified, this value defaults to `N - 1`, where `N` is the number of inputs.

**Outputs**

The median of the values in the `values` array.

**Example**

```toml
my_median_task [type="median"
                values=<[ $(fetch1), $(fetch2), $(fetch3) ]>
                allowedFaults=1]
```

Given the inputs `2`, `5`, and `20`, the task will return `5`.

## Memo task

The `memo` task returns its value as a result.

**Parameters**

- `value`: value to return. Possible values:
  - number
  - boolean
  - float
  - string
  - array

**Outputs**

The value.

**Example**

```toml
memo [type="memo" value="10"]
```

The task will return the value `10`

## Merge task

Merge task returns the merged value of two maps.

**Parameters**

- `left`: The left map.
- `right`: The right map, which overwrites the left side.

**Outputs**

Returns the combined map of left and right. If the merged map is invalid, it returns `null`.

**Example**

```toml
merge [type="merge" left="{\\"foo\\":\\"abc\\", \\"bar\\":\\"123\\"}" right="{\\"bar\\":\\"xyz\\", \\"biz\\":\\"buzz\\"}"]
```

This example task returns the following map:

```json
{ "foo": "abc", "bar": "xyz", "biz": "buzz" }
```

## Mode task

Accepts multiple numerical inputs and returns the mode (most common) of them. If more than one value occur the maximum number of times, it returns all of them.

**Parameters**

- `values`: an array of values from which to select a mode.
- `allowedFaults` (optional): the maximum number of input tasks that can error without the Mode task erroring. If not specified, this value defaults to `N - 1`, where `N` is the number of inputs.

**Outputs**

A map containing two keys:

```json
{
    "results": [ ... ], // An array containing all of the values that occurred the maximum number of times
    "occurrences": ..., // The number of times those values occurred
}
```

**Example**

```toml
my_mode_task [type="mode"
                values=<[ $(fetch1), $(fetch2), $(fetch3), $(fetch4), $(fetch5), $(fetch6), $(fetch7), $(fetch8) ]>
                allowedFaults=3]
```

This task can handle arrays with mixed types. For example, given a `values` array containing both strings and ints like `[ 2, 5, 2, "foo", "foo" "bar", "foo", 2 ]`, the task returns the following JSON:

```json
{
  "occurrences": 3,
  "results": [2, "foo"]
}
```

To encode the results array into the `ethabiencode` task, specify that the data is an array in the `abi` and point the data parameter to the results from your mode task. Because [argument encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html#argument-encoding) enforces types, all of the values in the array must be of the same type. As an example, you can encode the results of a `mode` task with an array of integers:

```toml
mode_task [type="mode" values=<[ 1, 2, 2, 3, 1 ]>]

encode_mode_task [type="ethabiencode" abi="(bytes32 requestId, uint64 occurrences, uint256[] results)" data="{\\"requestId\\": $(decode_log.requestId), \\"occurrences\\": $(mode_task.occurrences), \\"results\\": $(mode_task.results) }"]
```

In this example, the `mode` task returns the following result:

```json
{
  "occurrences": 2,
  "results": [2, 1]
}
```

The `ethabiencode` task encodes `results` as a `uint256[]` array.

## Multiply task

Multiplies the provided `input` and `times` values.

**Parameters**

- `input`: the value to be multiplied. Possible values:
  - number
  - stringified number
  - bytes-ified number
  - `$(variable)`
- `times`: the value to multiply the input with.
  - number
  - stringified number
  - bytes-ified number
  - `$(variable)`

**Outputs**

The result of the multiplication.

**Example**

```toml
my_multiply_task [type="multiply" input="$(json_parse_result)" times=3]
```

Given the input `10`, the task will return `30`.

## Sum Task

Accepts multiple numerical inputs and returns the sum of them.

**Parameters**

- `values`: an array of values to sum.
- `allowedFaults` (optional): the maximum number of input tasks that can error without the Sum task erroring. If not specified, this value defaults to `N - 1`, where `N` is the number of inputs.

**Outputs**

The sum of the values in the `values` array.

**Example**

```toml
my_sum_task [type="sum"
             values=<[ $(fetch1), $(fetch2), $(fetch3) ]>
             allowedFaults=1]
```

Given the inputs `2`, `5`, and `20`, the task will return `27`.

## Uppercase task

Accepts a string and returns an uppercase string.

**Parameters**

- `input`: a string.

**Outputs**

Uppercase string.

**Example**

```toml
my_uppercase_task [type="uppercase" input="Hello World!"]
```

Given the input `Hello World!`, the task will return `HELLO WORLD!`.

# Requirements
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/resources/requirements


## Hardware

The requirements for running a Chainlink node scale with the as the number of jobs that your node services. CPUs with the x86 architecture is recommended for production environments, but you can use Apple M1 systems for development if you run the Chainlink node in Docker.

- Minimum: At least **2 CPU cores** and **4 GB of RAM** will allow you to get a node running for testing and basic development.
- Recommended: For nodes in a production environment with over 100 jobs, you will need at least **4 CPU cores** and **8GB of RAM**.

If you run your PostgreSQL database locally, you will need additional hardware. To support more than 100 jobs, your database server will need at least **4 cores**, **16 GB of RAM**, and **100 GB of storage**.

If you run your node on AWS or another cloud platform, use a VM instance type with dedicated core time. [Burstable Performance Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/#Burstable_Performance_Instances) and VM instances with shared cores often have a limited number of [CPU credits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-credits-baseline-concepts.html), which do not perform well for Chainlink nodes that require consistent performance.

## Software

Chainlink nodes have the following software dependencies:

- Operating System: Linux, MacOS, or the [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - For production environments, Linux is recommended.
- Docker: Although it is possible to [build Chainlink nodes from source](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink), the best practice is to use the [Chainlink Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags) without `-root`.
- [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) versions `>= 12` (Version 12 and later).
  - If you use a database as a service, your database host must provide access to logs.
  - If you run the database on a separate system, [secure the TCP/IP connection with SSL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/ssl-tcp.html).

## Blockchain connectivity

Chainlink nodes require a fully-synced network client so that they can run onchain transactions and interact with deployed contracts. For Ethereum, see the list of [supported clients](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink#ethereum-execution-client-requirements). Other L1s, L2s, and side-chains use different clients. See your network's documentation to learn how to run a client for your specific network.

The client must meet the following requirements:

- You can use a provider like Alchemy or Infura, but running your own client can provide lower latency and greater decentralization.
- Run your Chainlink nodes on their own separate VM or system. Hardware and storage requirements for these clients will change over time, so you will likely need to scale their capacity separately from the system where you run your Chainlink nodes.
- The client must provide both HTTP and WebSocket connections secured with SSL. Most providers give you `https://` and `wss://` connections by default. If you run your own client, you must create a reverse proxy for your client using a web server like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). The web server handles the SSL encryption and forwards the connection to your client.

# Fulfilling Requests
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/fulfilling-requests


> **NOTE: Run a Chainlink node**
>
> This guide assumes you have a running Chainlink node. To learn how to run a node, see the [Running a Chainlink Node
> locally](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node) guide.

You can use your Chainlink nodes to fulfill requests. This guide shows you how to deploy your own operator contract and add jobs to your node so that it can provide data to smart contracts.

Chainlink nodes can fulfill requests from open or unauthenticated APIs without the need for [External Adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) as long as you've [added the jobs](#add-a-job-to-the-node) to the node. For these requests, requesters supply the URL to the open API that they want each node to retrieve. The Chainlink node will use [tasks](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/tasks) to fulfill the request.

Some APIs require authentication by providing request headers for the operator's API key, which the Chainlink node supports. If you would like to provide access to an API that requires authentication, you must create a job that is specific for that API either using an [external adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) or by using the parameters of the [HTTP task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task).

## Requirements

Before you begin this guide, complete the following tasks to make sure you have all of the tools that you need:

- [Set up MetaMask](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) and [obtain testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
- [Run a Chainlink Node](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node).
- Fund the Ethereum address that your Chainlink node uses. You can find the address in the node Operator GUI under the **Key Management** configuration. The address of the node is the `Regular` type. You can obtain test ETH from several [faucets](/resources/link-token-contracts). For this tutorial to work, you will have to fund the node's Ethereum address with Sepolia ETH. Here is an example:

  (Image: chainlink node fund address)

## Address types

Your node works with several different types of addresses. Each address type has a specific function:

- **Node address:** This is the address for your Chainlink node wallet. The node requires native gas tokens at all times to respond to requests. For this example, the node uses Sepolia ETH. When you start a Chainlink node, it automatically generates this address. You can find this address on the Node Operator GUI under **Key Management > EVM Chain Accounts**.
- **Oracle contract address:** This is the address for contracts like `Operator.sol` that are deployed to a blockchain. Do not fund these addresses with native gas tokens such as ETH. When you make API call requests, the funds pass through this contract to interact with your Chainlink node. This will be the address that smart contract developers point to when they choose a node for an API call.
- **Admin wallet address:** This is the address that owns your `Operator.sol` contract addresses. If you're on OCR, this is the wallet address that receives LINK tokens.

## Set up your Operator contract

### Deploy your own Operator contract

1. Go to Remix and open the [`Operator.sol` smart contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/ChainlinkNodes/Operator.sol\&autoCompile=true).

2. On the **Compile** tab, click the **Compile** button for `Operator.sol`. Remix automatically selects the compiler version and language from the `pragma` line unless you select a specific version manually.

3. On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:

   - Select "Injected Provider" as your **Environment**. The Javascript VM environment cannot access your oracle node. Make sure your Metamask is connected to Sepolia testnet.

   - Select the "Operator" contract from the **Contract** menu.

   - Copy the [LINK token contract address](/resources/link-token-contracts) for the network you are using and paste it into the `LINK` field next to the **Deploy** button. For Sepolia, you can use this address:

     ```text Sepolia
     0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789
     ```

   - Copy the *Admin wallet address* into the `OWNER` field.

   (Image: The Deploy & Run transaction window showing Injected Web 3 selected and the address for your MetaMask wallet.)

4. Click **transact**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

> **NOTE: MetaMask doesn't pop up?**
>
> If MetaMask does not prompt you and instead displays the error below, disable "Privacy Mode" in MetaMask. You can
> do this by clicking on your unique account icon at the top-right, then go to the Settings. Privacy Mode will be a
> switch near the bottom.

Error: **Send transaction failed: Invalid address. If you use an injected provider, please check it is properly
unlocked.**

1. If the transaction is successful, a new address displays in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

   (Image: Screenshot showing the newly deployed contract.)

2. Keep note of the Operator contract address. You need it later for your consuming contract.

### Whitelist your node address in the Operator contract

1. In the Chainlink node GUI, find and copy the address of your chainlink node. see [Requirements](#requirements).

2. In Remix, call the `setAuthorizedSenders` function with the address of your node. Note the function expects an array.

   (Image: A screenshot showing all of the fields for the deployed contract in Remix.)

3. Click the `transact` function to run it. Approve the transaction in MetaMask and wait for it to confirm on the blockchain.

4. Call `isAuthorizedSender` function with the address of your node to verify that your chainlink node address can call the operator contract. The function must return `true`.

   (Image: A screenshot showing Chainlink node whitelisted in Remix.)

## Add a job to the node

You will create a job that calls an OpenAPI , parses the response and then returns a `uint256`.

1. In the Chainlink Operator UI on the **Jobs** tab, click **New Job**.

   (Image: The new job button.)

2. Paste the job specification from above into the text field.

   <CodeSample src="samples/ChainlinkNodes/jobs/get-uint256.toml" />

3. Replace `YOUR_OPERATOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of your deployed operator contract address from the previous steps.

4. Click **Create Job**. If the node creates the job successfully, a notice with the job number appears.

   (Image: A screenshot showing that the job is created successfully.)

5. Click the job number to view the job details. You can also find the job listed on the **Jobs** tab in the Node Operators UI. Save the `externalJobID` value because you will need it later to tell your consumer contract what job ID to request from your node.

   (Image: A screenshot showing the External Job ID.)

## Create a request to your node

After you add jobs to your node, you can use the node to fulfill requests. This section shows what a requester does when they send requests to your node. It is also a way to test and make sure that your node is functioning correctly.

1. Open [ATestnetConsumer.sol in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/ATestnetConsumer.sol\&autoCompile=true).

2. Note that `_setChainlinkToken(0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789)` is configured for *Sepolia*.

3. On the **Compiler** tab, click the **Compile** button for `ATestnetConsumer.sol`.

4. On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:
   - Select *Injected Provider* as your environment. Make sure your metamask is connected to Sepolia.
   - Select *ATestnetConsumer* from the **Contract** menu.

5. Click **Deploy**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

6. Fund the contract by sending LINK to the contract's address. See the [Fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract) page for instructions. The address for the `ATestnetConsumer` contract is on the list of your deployed contracts in Remix. You can fund your contract with 1 LINK.

7. After you fund the contract, create a request. Input your operator contract address and the job ID for the `Get > Uint256` job into the `requestEthereumPrice` request method **without dashes**. The job ID is the `externalJobID` parameter, which you can find on your job's definition page in the Node Operators UI.

   (Image: Screenshot of the requestEthereumPrice function with the oracle address and job ID specified.)

8. Click the **transact** button for the `requestEthereumPrice` function and approve the transaction in Metamask. The `requestEthereumPrice` function asks the node to retrieve `uint256` data specifically from [https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH\&tsyms=USD](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH\&tsyms=USD).

9. After the transaction processes, you can see the details for the complete the job run the **Runs** page in the Node Operators UI.

   (Image: A screenshot of the task link)

10. In Remix, click the `currentPrice` variable to see the current price updated on your consumer contract.

    (Image: A screenshot of the currentPrice button)

## Withdrawing LINK

You can withdraw LINK from the operator contract. In Remix under the list of deployed contracts, click on your Operator contract and find the `withdraw` function in the function list. Note that only the admin (see [Admin wallet address](#address-types)) can withdraw LINK.

(Image: Remix Click Withdraw Button)

Paste the address you want to withdraw to, and specify the amount of LINK that you want to withdraw. Then, click `withdraw`. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask when the popup appears.

## Node Configuration (v1)
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config

# Node Config (TOML)
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config


[//]: # "Documentation generated from docs/*.toml - DO NOT EDIT."

This document describes the TOML format for configuration.

See also: [Secrets Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config)

## Example

```toml
Log.Level = 'debug'

[[EVM]]
ChainID = '1' # Required

[[EVM.Nodes]]
Name = 'fake' # Required
WSURL = 'wss://foo.bar/ws'
HTTPURL = 'https://foo.bar' # Required
```

## Global

```toml
InsecureFastScrypt = false # Default
InsecurePPROFHeap = false # Default
RootDir = '~/.chainlink' # Default
ShutdownGracePeriod = '5s' # Default
```

### InsecureFastScrypt

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
InsecureFastScrypt = false # Default
```

InsecureFastScrypt causes all key stores to encrypt using "fast" scrypt params instead. This is insecure and only useful for local testing. DO NOT ENABLE THIS IN PRODUCTION.

### InsecurePPROFHeap

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
InsecurePPROFHeap = false # Default
```

InsecurePPROFHeap allows dumping the heap in pprof. This is very useful for debugging memory leaks but in certain rare cases may potentially expose sensitive data e.g. private key components, so is disabled by default.

### RootDir

```toml
RootDir = '~/.chainlink' # Default
```

RootDir is the Chainlink node's root directory. This is the default directory for logging, database backups, cookies, and other misc Chainlink node files. Chainlink nodes will always ensure this directory has 700 permissions because it might contain sensitive data.

### ShutdownGracePeriod

```toml
ShutdownGracePeriod = '5s' # Default
```

ShutdownGracePeriod is the maximum time allowed to shut down gracefully. If exceeded, the node will terminate immediately to avoid being SIGKILLed.

## Feature

```toml
[Feature]
FeedsManager = true # Default
LogPoller = false # Default
UICSAKeys = false # Default
CCIP = true # Default
MultiFeedsManagers = false # Default
```

### FeedsManager

```toml
FeedsManager = true # Default
```

FeedsManager enables the feeds manager service.

### LogPoller

```toml
LogPoller = false # Default
```

LogPoller enables the log poller, an experimental approach to processing logs, required if also using Evm.UseForwarders or OCR2.

### UICSAKeys

```toml
UICSAKeys = false # Default
```

UICSAKeys enables CSA Keys in the UI.

### CCIP

```toml
CCIP = true # Default
```

CCIP enables the CCIP service.

### MultiFeedsManagers

```toml
MultiFeedsManagers = false # Default
```

MultiFeedsManagers enables support for multiple feeds manager connections.

## Database

```toml
[Database]
DefaultIdleInTxSessionTimeout = '1h' # Default
DefaultLockTimeout = '15s' # Default
DefaultQueryTimeout = '10s' # Default
LogQueries = false # Default
MaxIdleConns = 10 # Default
MaxOpenConns = 100 # Default
MigrateOnStartup = true # Default
```

### DefaultIdleInTxSessionTimeout

```toml
DefaultIdleInTxSessionTimeout = '1h' # Default
```

DefaultIdleInTxSessionTimeout is the maximum time allowed for a transaction to be open and idle before timing out. See Postgres `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` for more details.

### DefaultLockTimeout

```toml
DefaultLockTimeout = '15s' # Default
```

DefaultLockTimeout is the maximum time allowed to wait for database lock of any kind before timing out. See Postgres `lock_timeout` for more details.

### DefaultQueryTimeout

```toml
DefaultQueryTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

DefaultQueryTimeout is the maximum time allowed for standard queries before timing out.

### LogQueries

```toml
LogQueries = false # Default
```

LogQueries tells the Chainlink node to log database queries made using the default logger. SQL statements will be logged at `debug` level. Not all statements can be logged. The best way to get a true log of all SQL statements is to enable SQL statement logging on Postgres.

### MaxIdleConns

```toml
MaxIdleConns = 10 # Default
```

MaxIdleConns configures the maximum number of idle database connections that the Chainlink node will keep open. Think of this as the baseline number of database connections per Chainlink node instance. Increasing this number can help to improve performance under database-heavy workloads.

Postgres has connection limits, so you must use caution when increasing this value. If you are running several instances of a Chainlink node or another application on a single database server, you might run out of Postgres connection slots if you raise this value too high.

### MaxOpenConns

```toml
MaxOpenConns = 100 # Default
```

MaxOpenConns configures the maximum number of database connections that a Chainlink node will have open at any one time. Think of this as the maximum burst upper bound limit of database connections per Chainlink node instance. Increasing this number can help to improve performance under database-heavy workloads.

Postgres has connection limits, so you must use caution when increasing this value. If you are running several instances of a Chainlink node or another application on a single database server, you might run out of Postgres connection slots if you raise this value too high.

### MigrateOnStartup

```toml
MigrateOnStartup = true # Default
```

MigrateOnStartup controls whether a Chainlink node will attempt to automatically migrate the database on boot. If you want more control over your database migration process, set this variable to `false` and manually migrate the database using the CLI `migrate` command instead.

## Database.Backup

```toml
[Database.Backup]
Mode = 'none' # Default
Dir = 'test/backup/dir' # Example
OnVersionUpgrade = true # Default
Frequency = '1h' # Default
```

As a best practice, take regular database backups in case of accidental data loss. This best practice is especially important when you upgrade your Chainlink node to a new version. Chainlink nodes support automated database backups to make this process easier.

NOTE: Dumps can cause high load and massive database latencies, which will negatively impact the normal functioning of the Chainlink node. For this reason, it is recommended to set a `URL` and point it to a read replica if you enable automatic backups.

### Mode

```toml
Mode = 'none' # Default
```

Mode sets the type of automatic database backup, which can be one of *none*, `lite`, or `full`. If enabled, the Chainlink node will always dump a backup on every boot before running migrations. Additionally, it will automatically take database backups that overwrite the backup file for the given version at regular intervals if `Frequency` is set to a non-zero interval.

*none* - Disables backups.
`lite` - Dumps small tables including configuration and keys that are essential for the node to function, which excludes historical data like job runs, transaction history, etc.
`full` - Dumps the entire database.

It will write to a file like `'Dir'/backup/cl_backup_<VERSION>.dump`. There is one backup dump file per version of the Chainlink node. If you upgrade the node, it will keep the backup taken right before the upgrade migration so you can restore to an older version if necessary.

### Dir

```toml
Dir = 'test/backup/dir' # Example
```

Dir sets the directory to use for saving the backup file. Use this if you want to save the backup file in a directory other than the default ROOT directory.

### OnVersionUpgrade

```toml
OnVersionUpgrade = true # Default
```

OnVersionUpgrade enables automatic backups of the database before running migrations, when you are upgrading to a new version.

### Frequency

```toml
Frequency = '1h' # Default
```

Frequency sets the interval for database dumps, if set to a positive duration and `Mode` is not *none*.

Set to `0` to disable periodic backups.

## Database.Listener

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change these settings unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
[Database.Listener]
MaxReconnectDuration = '10m' # Default
MinReconnectInterval = '1m' # Default
FallbackPollInterval = '30s' # Default
```

These settings control the postgres event listener.

### MaxReconnectDuration

```toml
MaxReconnectDuration = '10m' # Default
```

MaxReconnectDuration is the maximum duration to wait between reconnect attempts.

### MinReconnectInterval

```toml
MinReconnectInterval = '1m' # Default
```

MinReconnectInterval controls the duration to wait before trying to re-establish the database connection after connection loss. After each consecutive failure this interval is doubled, until MaxReconnectInterval is reached. Successfully completing the connection establishment procedure resets the interval back to MinReconnectInterval.

### FallbackPollInterval

```toml
FallbackPollInterval = '30s' # Default
```

FallbackPollInterval controls how often clients should manually poll as a fallback in case the postgres event was missed/dropped.

## Database.Lock

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change these settings unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
[Database.Lock]
Enabled = true # Default
LeaseDuration = '10s' # Default
LeaseRefreshInterval = '1s' # Default
```

Ideally, you should use a container orchestration system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to ensure that only one Chainlink node instance can ever use a specific Postgres database. However, some node operators do not have the technical capacity to do this. Common use cases run multiple Chainlink node instances in failover mode as recommended by our official documentation. The first instance takes a lock on the database and subsequent instances will wait trying to take this lock in case the first instance fails.

- If your nodes or applications hold locks open for several hours or days, Postgres is unable to complete internal cleanup tasks. The Postgres maintainers explicitly discourage holding locks open for long periods of time.

Because of the complications with advisory locks, Chainlink nodes with v2.0 and later only support `lease` locking mode. The `lease` locking mode works using the following process:

- Node A creates one row in the database with the client ID and updates it once per second.
- Node B spinlocks and checks periodically to see if the client ID is too old. If the client ID is not updated after a period of time, node B assumes that node A failed and takes over. Node B becomes the owner of the row and updates the client ID once per second.
- If node A comes back, it attempts to take out a lease, realizes that the database has been leased to another process, and exits the entire application immediately.

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled enables the database lock.

### LeaseDuration

```toml
LeaseDuration = '10s' # Default
```

LeaseDuration is how long the lease lock will last before expiring.

### LeaseRefreshInterval

```toml
LeaseRefreshInterval = '1s' # Default
```

LeaseRefreshInterval determines how often to refresh the lease lock. Also controls how often a standby node will check to see if it can grab the lease.

## TelemetryIngress

```toml
[TelemetryIngress]
UniConn = false # Default
Logging = false # Default
BufferSize = 100 # Default
MaxBatchSize = 50 # Default
SendInterval = '500ms' # Default
SendTimeout = '10s' # Default
UseBatchSend = true # Default
ChipIngressEnabled = false # Default
```

### UniConn

```toml
UniConn = false # Default
```

UniConn toggles which ws connection style is used.

### Logging

```toml
Logging = false # Default
```

Logging toggles verbose logging of the raw telemetry messages being sent.

### BufferSize

```toml
BufferSize = 100 # Default
```

BufferSize is the number of telemetry messages to buffer before dropping new ones.

### MaxBatchSize

```toml
MaxBatchSize = 50 # Default
```

MaxBatchSize is the maximum number of messages to batch into one telemetry request.

### SendInterval

```toml
SendInterval = '500ms' # Default
```

SendInterval determines how often batched telemetry is sent to the ingress server.

### SendTimeout

```toml
SendTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

SendTimeout is the max duration to wait for the request to complete when sending batch telemetry.

### UseBatchSend

```toml
UseBatchSend = true # Default
```

UseBatchSend toggles sending telemetry to the ingress server using the batch client.

### ChipIngressEnabled

```toml
ChipIngressEnabled = false # Default
```

ChipIngressEnabled enables sending telemetry to CHIP Ingress.

## TelemetryIngress.Endpoints

```toml
[[TelemetryIngress.Endpoints]] # Example
Network = 'EVM' # Example
ChainID = '111551111' # Example
ServerPubKey = 'test-pub-key-111551111-evm' # Example
URL = 'localhost-111551111-evm:9000' # Example
```

### Network

```toml
Network = 'EVM' # Example
```

Network aka EVM, Solana, Starknet

### ChainID

```toml
ChainID = '111551111' # Example
```

ChainID of the network

### ServerPubKey

```toml
ServerPubKey = 'test-pub-key-111551111-evm' # Example
```

ServerPubKey is the public key of the telemetry server.

### URL

```toml
URL = 'localhost-111551111-evm:9000' # Example
```

URL is where to send telemetry.

## AuditLogger

```toml
[AuditLogger]
Enabled = false # Default
ForwardToUrl = 'http://localhost:9898' # Example
JsonWrapperKey = 'event' # Example
Headers = ['Authorization: token', 'X-SomeOther-Header: value with spaces | and a bar+*'] # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled determines if this logger should be configured at all

### ForwardToUrl

```toml
ForwardToUrl = 'http://localhost:9898' # Example
```

ForwardToUrl is where you want to forward logs to

### JsonWrapperKey

```toml
JsonWrapperKey = 'event' # Example
```

JsonWrapperKey if set wraps the map of data under another single key to make parsing easier

### Headers

```toml
Headers = ['Authorization: token', 'X-SomeOther-Header: value with spaces | and a bar+*'] # Example
```

Headers is the set of headers you wish to pass along with each request

## Log

```toml
[Log]
Level = 'info' # Default
JSONConsole = false # Default
UnixTS = false # Default
```

### Level

```toml
Level = 'info' # Default
```

Level determines only what is printed on the screen/console. This configuration does not apply to the logs that are recorded in a file (see [`Log.File`](#logfile) for more details).

The available levels are:

- "debug": Useful for forensic debugging of issues.
- "info": High-level informational messages. (default)
- "warn": A mild error occurred that might require non-urgent action. Check these warnings semi-regularly to see if any of them require attention. These warnings usually happen due to factors outside of the control of the node operator. Examples: Unexpected responses from a remote API or misleading networking errors.
- "error": An unexpected error occurred during the regular operation of a well-maintained node. Node operators might need to take action to remedy this error. Check these regularly to see if any of them require attention. Examples: Use of deprecated configuration options or incorrectly configured settings that cause a job to fail.
- "crit": A critical error occurred. The node might be unable to function. Node operators should take immediate action to fix these errors. Examples: The node could not boot because a network socket could not be opened or the database became inaccessible.
- "panic": An exceptional error occurred that could not be handled. If the node is unresponsive, node operators should try to restart their nodes and notify the Chainlink team of a potential bug.
- "fatal": The node encountered an unrecoverable problem and had to exit.

### JSONConsole

```toml
JSONConsole = false # Default
```

JSONConsole enables JSON logging. Otherwise, the log is saved in a human-friendly console format.

### UnixTS

```toml
UnixTS = false # Default
```

UnixTS enables legacy unix timestamps.

Previous versions of Chainlink nodes wrote JSON logs with a unix timestamp. As of v1.1.0 and up, the default has changed to use ISO8601 timestamps for better readability.

## Log.File

```toml
[Log.File]
Dir = '/my/log/directory' # Example
MaxSize = '5120mb' # Default
MaxAgeDays = 0 # Default
MaxBackups = 1 # Default
```

### Dir

```toml
Dir = '/my/log/directory' # Example
```

Dir sets the log directory. By default, Chainlink nodes write log data to `$ROOT/log.jsonl`.

### MaxSize

```toml
MaxSize = '5120mb' # Default
```

MaxSize determines the log file's max size before file rotation. Having this not set or set to a value smaller than 1Mb will disable logging to disk. If your disk doesn't have enough disk space, the logging will pause and the application will log errors until space is available again.

Values must have suffixes with a unit like: `5120mb` (5,120 megabytes). If no unit suffix is provided, the value defaults to `b` (bytes). The list of valid unit suffixes are:

- b (bytes)
- kb (kilobytes)
- mb (megabytes)
- gb (gigabytes)
- tb (terabytes)

### MaxAgeDays

```toml
MaxAgeDays = 0 # Default
```

MaxAgeDays determines the log file's max age in days before file rotation. Keeping this config with the default value will not remove log files based on age.

### MaxBackups

```toml
MaxBackups = 1 # Default
```

MaxBackups determines the maximum number of old log files to retain. Keeping this config with the default value retains all old log files. The `MaxAgeDays` variable can still cause them to get deleted.

## WebServer

```toml
[WebServer]
AuthenticationMethod = 'local' # Default
AllowOrigins = 'http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:6688' # Default
BridgeCacheTTL = '0s' # Default
BridgeResponseURL = 'https://my-chainlink-node.example.com:6688' # Example
HTTPWriteTimeout = '10s' # Default
HTTPPort = 6688 # Default
SecureCookies = true # Default
SessionTimeout = '15m' # Default
SessionReaperExpiration = '240h' # Default
HTTPMaxSize = '32768b' # Default
StartTimeout = '15s' # Default
ListenIP = '0.0.0.0' # Default
```

### AuthenticationMethod

```toml
AuthenticationMethod = 'local' # Default
```

AuthenticationMethod defines which pluggable auth interface to use for user login and role assumption. Options include 'local' and 'ldap'. See docs for more details

### AllowOrigins

```toml
AllowOrigins = 'http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:6688' # Default
```

AllowOrigins controls the URLs Chainlink nodes emit in the `Allow-Origins` header of its API responses. The setting can be a comma-separated list with no spaces. You might experience CORS issues if this is not set correctly.

You should set this to the external URL that you use to access the Chainlink UI.

You can set `AllowOrigins = '*'` to allow the UI to work from any URL, but it is recommended for security reasons to make it explicit instead.

### BridgeCacheTTL

```toml
BridgeCacheTTL = '0s' # Default
```

BridgeCacheTTL controls the cache TTL for all bridge tasks to use old values in newer observations in case of intermittent failure. It's disabled by default.

### BridgeResponseURL

```toml
BridgeResponseURL = 'https://my-chainlink-node.example.com:6688' # Example
```

BridgeResponseURL defines the URL for bridges to send a response to. This *must* be set when using async external adapters.

Usually this will be the same as the URL/IP and port you use to connect to the Chainlink UI.

### HTTPWriteTimeout

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
HTTPWriteTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

HTTPWriteTimeout controls how long the Chainlink node's API server can hold a socket open for writing a response to an HTTP request. Sometimes, this must be increased for pprof.

### HTTPPort

```toml
HTTPPort = 6688 # Default
```

HTTPPort is the port used for the Chainlink Node API, [CLI](/chainlink-nodes/configuring-nodes), and GUI.

### SecureCookies

```toml

When enabled, logging in will require the account password and a hardware or OS security key such as Yubikey. To enroll, log in to the operator UI and click the circle purple profile button at the top right and then click **Register MFA Token**. Tap your hardware security key or use the OS public key management feature to enroll a key. Next time you log in, this key will be required to authenticate.

### RPID

```

MaxRunDuration is the maximum time allowed for a single job run. If it takes longer, it will exit early and be marked errored. If set to zero, disables the time limit completely.

### MaxSuccessfulRuns

```toml
MaxSuccessfulRuns = 10000 # Default
```

MaxSuccessfulRuns caps the number of completed successful runs per pipeline
spec in the database. You can set it to zero as a performance optimisation;
this will avoid saving any successful run.

Note this is not a hard cap, it can drift slightly larger than this but not
by more than 5% or so.

### ReaperInterval

```toml
ReaperInterval = '1h' # Default
```

ReaperInterval controls how often the job pipeline reaper will run to delete completed jobs older than ReaperThreshold, in order to keep database size manageable.

Set to `0` to disable the periodic reaper.

### ReaperThreshold

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
ResultWriteQueueDepth = 100 # Default
```

ResultWriteQueueDepth controls how many writes will be buffered before subsequent writes are dropped, for jobs that write results asynchronously for performance reasons, such as OCR.

### VerboseLogging

```toml
VerboseLogging = true # Default
```

```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables OCR2 jobs.

### ContractConfirmations

```toml
ContractConfirmations = 3 # Default
```

ContractConfirmations is the number of block confirmations to wait for before enacting an on-chain
configuration change. This value doesn't need to be very high (in
particular, it does not need to protect against malicious re-orgs).
Since configuration changes create some overhead, and mini-reorgs
are fairly common, recommended values are between two and ten.

Malicious re-orgs are not any more of concern here than they are in
blockchain applications in general: Since nodes check the contract for the
latest config every ContractConfigTrackerPollInterval.Seconds(), they will
come to a common view of the current config within any interval longer than
that, as long as the latest setConfig transaction in the longest chain is
stable. They will thus be able to continue reporting after the poll
interval, unless an adversary is able to repeatedly re-org the transaction
out during every poll interval, which would amount to the capability to
censor any transaction.

Note that 1 confirmation implies that the transaction/event has been mined in one block.
0 confirmations would imply that the event would be recognised before it has even been mined, which is not currently supported.
e.g.
Current block height: 42
Changed in block height: 43
Contract config confirmations: 1
STILL PENDING

Current block height: 43
Changed in block height: 43
Contract config confirmations: 1
CONFIRMED

### BlockchainTimeout

```toml
BlockchainTimeout = '20s' # Default
```

BlockchainTimeout is the timeout for blockchain queries (mediated through
ContractConfigTracker and ContractTransmitter).

```

P2P has a versioned networking stack. Currently only `[P2P.V2]` is supported.
All nodes in the OCR network should share the same networking stack.

### IncomingMessageBufferSize

```toml
IncomingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
```

IncomingMessageBufferSize is the per-remote number of incoming
messages to buffer. Any additional messages received on top of those
already in the queue will be dropped.

### OutgoingMessageBufferSize

```toml
OutgoingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
```

OutgoingMessageBufferSize is the per-remote number of outgoing
messages to buffer. Any additional messages send on top of those
already in the queue will displace the oldest.
NOTE: OutgoingMessageBufferSize should be comfortably smaller than remote's
IncomingMessageBufferSize to give the remote enough space to process
them all in case we regained connection and now send a bunch at once

DeltaDial = '15s' # Default
DeltaReconcile = '1m' # Default
ListenAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled enables P2P V2.
Note: V1.Enabled is true by default, so it must be set false in order to run V2 only.

### AnnounceAddresses

```toml
AnnounceAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

AnnounceAddresses is the addresses the peer will advertise on the network in `host:port` form as accepted by the TCP version of Go’s `net.Dial`.
The addresses should be reachable by other nodes on the network. When attempting to connect to another node,
a node will attempt to dial all of the other node’s AnnounceAddresses in round-robin fashion.

### DefaultBootstrappers

```toml
DefaultBootstrappers = ['12D3KooWMHMRLQkgPbFSYHwD3NBuwtS1AmxhvKVUrcfyaGDASR4U@1.2.3.4:9999', '12D3KooWM55u5Swtpw9r8aFLQHEtw7HR4t44GdNs654ej5gRs2Dh@example.com:1234'] # Example
```

DefaultBootstrappers is the default bootstrapper peers for libocr's v2 networking stack.

Oracle nodes typically only know each other’s PeerIDs, but not their hostnames, IP addresses, or ports.
DefaultBootstrappers are special nodes that help other nodes discover each other’s `AnnounceAddresses` so they can communicate.
Nodes continuously attempt to connect to bootstrappers configured in here. When a node wants to connect to another node
(which it knows only by PeerID, but not by address), it discovers the other node’s AnnounceAddresses from communications
received from its DefaultBootstrappers or other discovered nodes. To facilitate discovery,
nodes will regularly broadcast signed announcements containing their PeerID and AnnounceAddresses.

### DeltaDial

```toml
DeltaDial = '15s' # Default
```

DeltaDial controls how far apart Dial attempts are

### DeltaReconcile

```toml
DeltaReconcile = '1m' # Default
```

DeltaReconcile controls how often a Reconcile message is sent to every peer.

### ListenAddresses

```toml
ListenAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

ListenAddresses is the addresses the peer will listen to on the network in `host:port` form as accepted by `net.Listen()`,
but the host and port must be fully specified and cannot be empty. You can specify `0.0.0.0` (IPv4) or `::` (IPv6) to listen on all interfaces, but that is not recommended.

### AnnounceAddresses

```toml
AnnounceAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

AnnounceAddresses is the addresses the peer will advertise on the network in `host:port` form as accepted by the TCP version of Go’s `net.Dial`.
The addresses should be reachable by other nodes on the network. When attempting to connect to another node,
a node will attempt to dial all of the other node’s AnnounceAddresses in round-robin fashion.

### DefaultBootstrappers

```toml

```

DefaultBootstrappers is the default bootstrapper peers for libocr's v2 networking stack.

Oracle nodes typically only know each other’s PeerIDs, but not their hostnames, IP addresses, or ports.
DefaultBootstrappers are special nodes that help other nodes discover each other’s `AnnounceAddresses` so they can communicate.
Nodes continuously attempt to connect to bootstrappers configured in here. When a node wants to connect to another node
(which it knows only by PeerID, but not by address), it discovers the other node’s AnnounceAddresses from communications
received from its DefaultBootstrappers or other discovered nodes. To facilitate discovery,
nodes will regularly broadcast signed announcements containing their PeerID and AnnounceAddresses.

price that was queried from now-LatestReportTTL or before.

Setting to zero disables caching entirely.

### MaxStaleAge

### TransmitQueueMaxSize

```toml
TransmitQueueMaxSize = 250_000 # Default
```

TransmitQueueMaxSize controls the size of the transmit queue. This is scoped
per OCR instance. If the queue is full, the transmitter will start dropping
the oldest messages in order to make space.

This is useful if mercury server goes offline and the nop needs to buffer
transmissions.

### TransmitTimeout

```toml
TransmitTimeout = "5s" # Default
```

TransmitTimeout controls how long the transmitter will wait for a response
when sending a message to the mercury server, before aborting and considering
the transmission to be failed.

### ChainID

```toml
ChainID = '1' # Example
```

ChainID is the EVM chain ID. Mandatory.

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled enables this chain.

### AutoCreateKey

```toml
AutoCreateKey = true # Default
```

AutoCreateKey, if set to true, will ensure that there is always at least one transmit key for the given chain.

### BlockBackfillDepth

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
BlockBackfillDepth = 10 # Default
```

BlockBackfillDepth specifies the number of blocks before the current HEAD that the log broadcaster will try to re-consume logs from.

### BlockBackfillSkip

```toml
BlockBackfillSkip = false # Default
```

BlockBackfillSkip enables skipping of very long backfills.

### ChainType

```toml
ChainType = 'arbitrum' # Example
```

ChainType is automatically detected from chain ID. Set this to force a certain chain type regardless of chain ID.
Available types: `arbitrum`, `celo`, `gnosis`, `hedera`, `kroma`, `metis`, `optimismBedrock`, `scroll`, `wemix`, `xlayer`, `zksync`

### SafeDepth

```toml
SafeDepth = 0 # Default
```

SafeDepth is the number of blocks after which an ethereum transaction is considered "safe."
Note that this setting is only used for chains with FinalityTags = false
This number represents a number of blocks we consider large enough that reorgs are generally not likely to happen.
Note that this number is different from FinalityDepth, which is the number of blocks after which a transaction is considered final.
It is used in cases where we don't want to wait for finality.

Special cases:
`SafeDepth`=0 would imply that its value will fall back to the `FinalityDepth` value, if FinalityTagEnabled is false.

Examples:

Transaction sending:
A transaction is sent at block height 42

`SafeDepth` is set to 5, FinalityTagEnabled = false, and FinalityDepth = 10
At block height 47, the transaction is considered safe, but not final.
At block height 52, the transaction is considered final.

### FinalityDepth

```toml
FinalityDepth = 50 # Default
```

FinalityDepth is the number of blocks after which an ethereum transaction is considered "final". Note that the default is automatically set based on chain ID, so it should not be necessary to change this under normal operation.
BlocksConsideredFinal determines how deeply we look back to ensure that transactions are confirmed onto the longest chain
There is not a large performance penalty to setting this relatively high (on the order of hundreds)
It is practically limited by the number of heads we store in the database and should be less than this with a comfortable margin.
If a transaction is mined in a block more than this many blocks ago, and is reorged out, we will NOT retransmit this transaction and undefined behaviour can occur including gaps in the nonce sequence that require manual intervention to fix.
Therefore, this number represents a number of blocks we consider large enough that no re-org this deep will ever feasibly happen.

Special cases:
`FinalityDepth`=0 would imply that transactions can be final even before they were mined into a block. This is not supported.
`FinalityDepth`=1 implies that transactions are final after we see them in one block.

Examples:

Transaction sending:
A transaction is sent at block height 42

`FinalityDepth` is set to 5
A re-org occurs at height 44 starting at block 41, transaction is marked for rebroadcast
A re-org occurs at height 46 starting at block 41, transaction is marked for rebroadcast
A re-org occurs at height 47 starting at block 41, transaction is NOT marked for rebroadcast

### FinalityTagEnabled

```toml
FinalityTagEnabled = false # Default
```

FinalityTagEnabled means that the chain supports the finalized block tag when querying for a block. If FinalityTagEnabled is set to true for a chain, then FinalityDepth field is ignored.
Finality for a block is solely defined by the finality related tags provided by the chain's RPC API. This is a placeholder and hasn't been implemented yet.

### SafeTagSupported

```toml
SafeTagSupported = true # Default
```

SafeTagSupported means that the chain supports the safe block tag when querying for a block.
When FinalityTagEnabled is true and SafeTagSupported is false, LatestSafeBlock will return the finalized block instead of safe block.
When SafeTagSupported is true, LatestSafeBlock will return the safe block from the chain.
When FinalityTagEnabled is false, SafeTagSupported is ignored and LatestSafeBlock uses SafeDepth.

### FlagsContractAddress

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
FlagsContractAddress = '0xae4E781a6218A8031764928E88d457937A954fC3' # Example
```

FlagsContractAddress can optionally point to a [Flags contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/l2ep/Flags.sol). If set, the node will lookup that contract for each job that supports flags contracts (currently OCR and FM jobs are supported). If the job's contractAddress is set as hibernating in the FlagsContractAddress address, it overrides the standard update parameters (such as heartbeat/threshold).

### LinkContractAddress

```toml
LinkContractAddress = '0x538aAaB4ea120b2bC2fe5D296852D948F07D849e' # Example
```

LinkContractAddress is the canonical ERC-677 LINK token contract address on the given chain. Note that this is usually autodetected from chain ID.

### LogBackfillBatchSize

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
LogBackfillBatchSize = 1000 # Default
```

LogBackfillBatchSize sets the batch size for calling FilterLogs when we backfill missing logs.

### LogPollInterval

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
LogPollInterval = '15s' # Default
```

LogPollInterval works in conjunction with Feature.LogPoller. Controls how frequently the log poller polls for logs. Defaults to the block production rate.

### LogKeepBlocksDepth

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
LogKeepBlocksDepth = 100000 # Default
```

LogKeepBlocksDepth works in conjunction with Feature.LogPoller. Controls how many blocks the poller will keep, must be greater than FinalityDepth+1.

### LogPrunePageSize

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
LogPrunePageSize = 0 # Default
```

LogPrunePageSize defines size of the page for pruning logs. Controls how many logs/blocks (at most) are deleted in a single prune tick. Default value 0 means no paging, delete everything at once.

### BackupLogPollerBlockDelay

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
BackupLogPollerBlockDelay = 100 # Default
```

BackupLogPollerBlockDelay works in conjunction with Feature.LogPoller. Controls the block delay of Backup LogPoller, affecting how far behind the latest finalized block it starts and how often it runs.
BackupLogPollerDelay=0 will disable Backup LogPoller (*not recommended for production environment*).

### MinContractPayment

```toml
MinContractPayment = '10000000000000 juels' # Default
```

MinContractPayment is the minimum payment in LINK required to execute a direct request job. This can be overriden on a per-job basis.

### MinIncomingConfirmations

```toml
MinIncomingConfirmations = 3 # Default
```

MinIncomingConfirmations is the minimum required confirmations before a log event will be consumed.

### NonceAutoSync

```toml
NonceAutoSync = true # Default
```

NonceAutoSync enables automatic nonce syncing on startup. Chainlink nodes will automatically try to sync its local nonce with the remote chain on startup and fast forward if necessary. This is almost always safe but can be disabled in exceptional cases by setting this value to false.

### NoNewHeadsThreshold

```toml
NoNewHeadsThreshold = '3m' # Default
```

NoNewHeadsThreshold controls how long to wait after receiving no new heads before `NodePool` marks rpc endpoints as
out-of-sync, and `HeadTracker` logs warnings.

Set to zero to disable out-of-sync checking.

### OperatorFactoryAddress

```toml
OperatorFactoryAddress = '0xa5B85635Be42F21f94F28034B7DA440EeFF0F418' # Example
```

OperatorFactoryAddress is the address of the canonical operator forwarder contract on the given chain. Note that this is usually autodetected from chain ID.

### RPCDefaultBatchSize

```toml
RPCDefaultBatchSize = 250 # Default
```

RPCDefaultBatchSize is the default batch size for batched RPC calls.

### RPCBlockQueryDelay

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
RPCBlockQueryDelay = 1 # Default
```

RPCBlockQueryDelay controls the number of blocks to trail behind head in the block history estimator and balance monitor.
For example, if this is set to 3, and we receive block 10, block history estimator will fetch block 7.

CAUTION: You might be tempted to set this to 0 to use the latest possible
block, but it is possible to receive a head BEFORE that block is actually
available from the connected node via RPC, due to race conditions in the code of the remote ETH node. In this case you will get false
"zero" blocks that are missing transactions.

### FinalizedBlockOffset

```toml
FinalizedBlockOffset = 0 # Default
```

FinalizedBlockOffset defines the number of blocks by which the latest finalized block will be shifted/delayed.
For example, suppose RPC returns block 100 as the latest finalized. In that case, the CL Node will treat block `100 - FinalizedBlockOffset` as the latest finalized block and `latest - FinalityDepth - FinalizedBlockOffset` in case of `FinalityTagEnabled = false.`
With `EnforceRepeatableRead = true,` RPC is considered healthy only if its most recent finalized block is larger or equal to the highest finalized block observed by the CL Node minus `FinalizedBlockOffset.`
Higher values of `FinalizedBlockOffset` with `EnforceRepeatableRead = true` reduce the number of false `FinalizedBlockOutOfSync` declarations on healthy RPCs that are slightly lagging behind due to network delays.
This may increase the number of healthy RPCs and reduce the probability that the CL Node will not have any healthy alternatives to the active RPC.
CAUTION: Setting this to values higher than 0 may delay transaction creation in products (e.g., CCIP, Automation) that base their decision on finalized on-chain events.
PoS chains with `FinalityTagEnabled=true` and batched (epochs) blocks finalization (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet) must be treated with special care as a minor increase in the `FinalizedBlockOffset` may lead to significant delays.
For example, let's say that `FinalizedBlockOffset = 1` and blocks are finalized in batches of 32.
The latest finalized block on chain is 64, so block 63 is the latest finalized for CL Node.
Block 64 will be treated as finalized by CL Node only when chain's latest finalized block is 65. As chain finalizes blocks in batches of 32,
CL Node has to wait for a whole new batch to be finalized to treat block 64 as finalized.

### LogBroadcasterEnabled

```toml
LogBroadcasterEnabled = true # Default
```

LogBroadcasterEnabled is a feature flag for LogBroadcaster, by default it's true.

### NoNewFinalizedHeadsThreshold

```toml
NoNewFinalizedHeadsThreshold = '0' # Default
```

NoNewFinalizedHeadsThreshold controls how long to wait for new finalized block before `NodePool` marks rpc endpoints as
out-of-sync. Only applicable if `FinalityTagEnabled=true`

Set to zero to disable.

## EVM.Transactions

```toml
[EVM.Transactions]
ConfirmationTimeout = '60s' # Default
Enabled = true # Default
ForwardersEnabled = false # Default
MaxInFlight = 16 # Default
MaxQueued = 250 # Default
ReaperInterval = '1h' # Default
ReaperThreshold = '168h' # Default
ResendAfterThreshold = '1m' # Default
```

### ConfirmationTimeout

```toml
ConfirmationTimeout = '60s' # Default
```

ConfirmationTimeout time to wait for a TX to get into a block in the blockchain. This is used for the EVMService.SubmitTransaction operation.

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled is a feature flag for the Transaction Manager. This flag also enables or disables the gas estimator since it is dependent on the TXM to start it.

### ForwardersEnabled

```toml
ForwardersEnabled = false # Default
```

ForwardersEnabled enables or disables sending transactions through forwarder contracts.

### MaxInFlight

```toml
MaxInFlight = 16 # Default
```

MaxInFlight controls how many transactions are allowed to be "in-flight" i.e. broadcast but unconfirmed at any one time. You can consider this a form of transaction throttling.

The default is set conservatively at 16 because this is a pessimistic minimum that both geth and parity will hold without evicting local transactions. If your node is falling behind and you need higher throughput, you can increase this setting, but you MUST make sure that your ETH node is configured properly otherwise you can get nonce gapped and your node will get stuck.

0 value disables the limit. Use with caution.

### MaxQueued

```toml
MaxQueued = 250 # Default
```

MaxQueued is the maximum number of unbroadcast transactions per key that are allowed to be enqueued before jobs will start failing and rejecting send of any further transactions. This represents a sanity limit and generally indicates a problem with your ETH node (transactions are not getting mined).

Do NOT blindly increase this value thinking it will fix things if you start hitting this limit because transactions are not getting mined, you will instead only make things worse.

In deployments with very high burst rates, or on chains with large re-orgs, you *may* consider increasing this.

0 value disables any limit on queue size. Use with caution.

### ReaperInterval

```toml
ReaperInterval = '1h' # Default
```

ReaperInterval controls how often the EthTx reaper will run.

### ReaperThreshold

```toml
ReaperThreshold = '168h' # Default
```

ReaperThreshold indicates how old an EthTx ought to be before it can be reaped.

### ResendAfterThreshold

```toml
ResendAfterThreshold = '1m' # Default
```

ResendAfterThreshold controls how long to wait before re-broadcasting a transaction that has not yet been confirmed.

## EVM.Transactions.AutoPurge

```toml
[EVM.Transactions.AutoPurge]
Enabled = false # Default
DetectionApiUrl = 'https://example.api.io' # Example
Threshold = 5 # Example
MinAttempts = 3 # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables or disables automatically purging transactions that have been identified as terminally stuck (will never be included on-chain). This feature is only expected to be used by ZK chains.

### DetectionApiUrl

```toml
DetectionApiUrl = 'https://example.api.io' # Example
```

DetectionApiUrl configures the base url of a custom endpoint used to identify terminally stuck transactions.

### Threshold

```toml
Threshold = 5 # Example
```

Threshold configures the number of blocks a transaction has to remain unconfirmed before it is evaluated for being terminally stuck. This threshold is only applied if there is no custom API to identify stuck transactions provided by the chain.

### MinAttempts

```toml
MinAttempts = 3 # Example
```

MinAttempts configures the minimum number of broadcasted attempts a transaction has to have before it is evaluated further for being terminally stuck. This threshold is only applied if there is no custom API to identify stuck transactions provided by the chain. Ensure the gas estimator configs take more bump attempts before reaching the configured max gas price.

## EVM.Transactions.TransactionManagerV2

```toml
[EVM.Transactions.TransactionManagerV2]
Enabled = false # Default
BlockTime = '10s' # Example
CustomURL = 'https://example.api.io' # Example
DualBroadcast = false # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables TransactionManagerV2.

### BlockTime

```toml
BlockTime = '10s' # Example
```

BlockTime controls the frequency of the backfill loop of TransactionManagerV2.

### CustomURL

```toml
CustomURL = 'https://example.api.io' # Example
```

CustomURL configures the base url of a custom endpoint used by the ChainDualBroadcast chain type.

### DualBroadcast

```toml
DualBroadcast = false # Example
```

DualBroadcast enables DualBroadcast functionality.

## EVM.BalanceMonitor

```toml
[EVM.BalanceMonitor]
Enabled = true # Default
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled balance monitoring for all keys.

## EVM.GasEstimator

```toml
[EVM.GasEstimator]
Mode = 'BlockHistory' # Default
PriceDefault = '20 gwei' # Default
PriceMax = '115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665.640564039457584007913129639935 tether' # Default

LimitTransfer = 21_000 # Default
EstimateLimit = false # Default
SenderAddress = '0x00c11c11c11C11c11C11c11c11C11C11c11C11c1' # Example
BumpMin = '5 gwei' # Default
BumpPercent = 20 # Default
BumpThreshold = 3 # Default
BumpTxDepth = 16 # Example
EIP1559DynamicFees = false # Default
FeeCapDefault = '100 gwei' # Default
TipCapDefault = '1 wei' # Default
TipCapMin = '1 wei' # Default
```

### Mode

```toml
Mode = 'BlockHistory' # Default
```

Mode controls what type of gas estimator is used.

- `FixedPrice` uses static configured values for gas price (can be set via API call).
- `BlockHistory` dynamically adjusts default gas price based on heuristics from mined blocks.
- `L2Suggested` mode is deprecated and replaced with `SuggestedPrice`.
- `SuggestedPrice` is a mode which uses the gas price suggested by the rpc endpoint via `eth_gasPrice`.
- `Arbitrum` is a special mode only for use with Arbitrum blockchains. It uses the suggested gas price (up to `ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI`, with `1000 gwei` default) as well as an estimated gas limit (up to `ETH_GAS_LIMIT_MAX`, with `1,000,000,000` default).

Chainlink nodes decide what gas price to use using an `Estimator`. It ships with several simple and battle-hardened built-in estimators that should work well for almost all use-cases. Note that estimators will change their behaviour slightly depending on if you are in EIP-1559 mode or not.

You can also use your own estimator for gas price by selecting the `FixedPrice` estimator and using the exposed API to set the price.

An important point to note is that the Chainlink node does *not* ship with built-in support for go-ethereum's `estimateGas` call. This is for several reasons, including security and reliability. We have found empirically that it is not generally safe to rely on the remote ETH node's idea of what gas price should be.

### PriceDefault

```toml
PriceDefault = '20 gwei' # Default
```

PriceDefault is the default gas price to use when submitting transactions to the blockchain. Will be overridden by the built-in `BlockHistoryEstimator` if enabled, and might be increased if gas bumping is enabled.

(Only applies to legacy transactions)

Can be used with the `chainlink setgasprice` to be updated while the node is still running.

### PriceMax

```toml
PriceMax = '115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665.640564039457584007913129639935 tether' # Default
```

PriceMax is the maximum gas price. Chainlink nodes will never pay more than this for a transaction.
This applies to both legacy and EIP1559 transactions.
Note that it is impossible to disable the maximum limit. Setting this value to zero will prevent paying anything for any transaction (which can be useful in some rare cases).
Most chains by default have the maximum set to 2\*\*256-1 Wei which is the maximum allowed gas price on EVM-compatible chains, and is so large it may as well be unlimited.

### PriceMin

```toml
PriceMin = '1 gwei' # Default
```

PriceMin is the minimum gas price. Chainlink nodes will never pay less than this for a transaction.

(Only applies to legacy transactions)

It is possible to force the Chainlink node to use a fixed gas price by setting a combination of these, e.g.

```toml
EIP1559DynamicFees = false
PriceMax = 100
PriceMin = 100
PriceDefault = 100
BumpThreshold = 0
Mode = 'FixedPrice'
```

### LimitDefault

```toml
LimitDefault = 500_000 # Default
```

LimitDefault sets default gas limit for outgoing transactions. This should not need to be changed in most cases.
Some job types, such as Keeper jobs, might set their own gas limit unrelated to this value.

### LimitMax

```toml
LimitMax = 500_000 # Default
```

LimitMax sets a maximum for *estimated* gas limits. This currently only applies to `Arbitrum` `GasEstimatorMode`.

### LimitMultiplier

```toml
LimitMultiplier = '1.0' # Default
```

LimitMultiplier is the factor by which a transaction's GasLimit is multiplied before transmission. So if the value is 1.1, and the GasLimit for a transaction is 10, 10% will be added before transmission.

This factor is always applied, so includes L2 transactions which uses a default gas limit of 1 and is also applied to `LimitDefault`.

### LimitTransfer

```toml
LimitTransfer = 21_000 # Default
```

LimitTransfer is the gas limit used for an ordinary ETH transfer.

### EstimateLimit

```toml
EstimateLimit = false # Default
```

EstimateLimit enables estimating gas limits for transactions. This feature respects the gas limit provided during transaction creation as an upper bound.

### SenderAddress

```toml
SenderAddress = '0x00c11c11c11C11c11C11c11c11C11C11c11C11c1' # Example
```

SenderAddress is optional and can be set to a specific sender address for gas limit estimation (i.e. `EstimateLimit = true`). If gas limit estimation is not enabled, this parameter is ignored.

If you are using gas limit estimation:

- Setting SenderAddress is optional for most products. If it is set, the from address for the transaction for gas estimation will be set to the inputted SenderAddress. If it is not set, the actual address the transaction is sent from is used if available.
- Setting SenderAddress is necessary for gas limit estimation to function correctly for CCIP. Gas limit estimation works only in CCIP 1.6 and above if SenderAddress is set to the given example value (0x00c11c11c11C11c11C11c11c11C11C11c11C11c1). This value is hardcoded in the CCIP 1.6 contracts and is not needed for other products.

### BumpMin

```toml
BumpMin = '5 gwei' # Default
```

BumpMin is the minimum fixed amount of wei by which gas is bumped on each transaction attempt.

### BumpPercent

```toml
BumpPercent = 20 # Default
```

BumpPercent is the percentage by which to bump gas on a transaction that has exceeded `BumpThreshold`. The larger of `BumpPercent` and `BumpMin` is taken for gas bumps.

The `SuggestedPriceEstimator` adds the larger of `BumpPercent` and `BumpMin` on top of the price provided by the RPC when bumping a transaction's gas.

### BumpThreshold

```toml
BumpThreshold = 3 # Default
```

BumpThreshold is the number of blocks to wait for a transaction stuck in the mempool before automatically bumping the gas price. Set to 0 to disable gas bumping completely.

### BumpTxDepth

```toml
BumpTxDepth = 16 # Example
```

BumpTxDepth is the number of transactions to gas bump starting from oldest. Set to 0 for no limit (i.e. bump all). Can not be greater than EVM.Transactions.MaxInFlight. If not set, defaults to EVM.Transactions.MaxInFlight.

### EIP1559DynamicFees

```toml
EIP1559DynamicFees = false # Default
```

EIP1559DynamicFees torces EIP-1559 transaction mode. Enabling EIP-1559 mode can help reduce gas costs on chains that support it. This is supported only on official Ethereum mainnet and testnets. It is not recommended to enable this setting on Polygon because the EIP-1559 fee market appears to be broken on all Polygon chains and EIP-1559 transactions are less likely to be included than legacy transactions.

#### Technical details

Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope.

EIP-1559 mode is enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet, but can be enabled on a per-chain basis or globally.

This might help to save gas on spikes. Chainlink nodes should react faster on the upleg and avoid overpaying on the downleg. It might also be possible to set `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.BatchSize` to a smaller value such as 12 or even 6 because tip cap should be a more consistent indicator of inclusion time than total gas price. This would make Chainlink nodes more responsive and should reduce response time variance. Some experimentation is required to find optimum settings.

Set with caution, if you set this on a chain that does not actually support EIP-1559 your node will be broken.

In EIP-1559 mode, the total price for the transaction is the minimum of base fee + tip cap and fee cap. More information can be found on the [official EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).

Chainlink's implementation of EIP-1559 works as follows:

If you are using FixedPriceEstimator:

- With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=PriceMax` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`
- With gas bumping enabled, it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=GasFeeCapDefault` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`.

If you are using BlockHistoryEstimator (default for most chains):

- With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=PriceMax` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
- With gas bumping enabled (default for most chains) it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap = ( current block base fee * (1.125 ^ N) + tipcap )` where N is configurable by setting `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks` but defaults to `gas bump threshold+1` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`

Bumping works as follows:

- Increase tipcap by `max(tipcap * (1 + BumpPercent), tipcap + BumpMin)`
- Increase feecap by `max(feecap * (1 + BumpPercent), feecap + BumpMin)`

A quick note on terminology - Chainlink nodes use the same terms used internally by go-ethereum source code to describe various prices. This is not the same as the externally used terms. For reference:

- Base Fee Per Gas = BaseFeePerGas
- Max Fee Per Gas = FeeCap
- Max Priority Fee Per Gas = TipCap

In EIP-1559 mode, the following changes occur to how configuration works:

- All new transactions will be sent as type 0x2 transactions specifying a TipCap and FeeCap. Be aware that existing pending legacy transactions will continue to be gas bumped in legacy mode.
- `BlockHistoryEstimator` will apply its calculations (gas percentile etc) to the TipCap and this value will be used for new transactions (GasPrice will be ignored)
- `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasTipCapDefault` instead of `GasPriceDefault` for the tip cap
- `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasFeeCapDefault` instead of `GasPriceDefault` for the fee cap
- `PriceMin` is ignored for new transactions and `GasTipCapMinimum` is used instead (default 0)
- `PriceMax` still represents that absolute upper limit that Chainlink will ever spend (total) on a single tx
- `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is ignored in EIP-1559 mode and `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is used instead

### FeeCapDefault

```toml
FeeCapDefault = '100 gwei' # Default
```

FeeCapDefault controls the fixed initial fee cap, if EIP1559 mode is enabled and `FixedPrice` gas estimator is used.

### TipCapDefault

```toml
TipCapDefault = '1 wei' # Default
```

TipCapDefault is the default gas tip to use when submitting transactions to the blockchain. Will be overridden by the built-in `BlockHistoryEstimator` if enabled, and might be increased if gas bumping is enabled.

(Only applies to EIP-1559 transactions)

### TipCapMin

```toml
TipCapMin = '1 wei' # Default
```

TipCapMinimum is the minimum gas tip to use when submitting transactions to the blockchain.

(Only applies to EIP-1559 transactions)

OracleType = 'opstack' # Example
OracleAddress = '0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F' # Example
CustomGasPriceCalldata = '' # Default
```

### OracleType

```toml
OracleType = 'opstack' # Example
```

OracleType refers to the oracle family this config belongs to. Currently the available oracle types are: 'opstack', 'arbitrum', 'zksync', and 'custom\_calldata'.

### OracleAddress

[EVM.GasEstimator.LimitJobType]
OCR = 100_000 # Example
OCR2 = 100_000 # Example
DR = 100_000 # Example

```

OCR overrides LimitDefault for OCR jobs.

### OCR2

```toml
OCR2 = 100_000 # Example
```

OCR2 overrides LimitDefault for OCR2 jobs.

### DR

```toml
DR = 100_000 # Example
```

DR overrides LimitDefault for Direct Request jobs.

### VRF

VRF = 100_000 # Example
```

VRF overrides LimitDefault for VRF jobs.

### FM

```toml
FM = 100_000 # Example

Keeper = 100_000 # Example
```

Keeper overrides LimitDefault for Keeper jobs.

## EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory

```toml
[EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory]
BatchSize = 25 # Default
BlockHistorySize = 8 # Default
CheckInclusionBlocks = 12 # Default
CheckInclusionPercentile = 90 # Default
EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks = 13 # Example
TransactionPercentile = 60 # Default
```

These settings allow you to configure how your node calculates gas prices when using the block history estimator.
In most cases, leaving these values at their defaults should give good results.

### BatchSize

```toml
BatchSize = 25 # Default
```

BatchSize sets the maximum number of blocks to fetch in one batch in the block history estimator.
If the `BatchSize` variable is set to 0, it defaults to `EVM.RPCDefaultBatchSize`.

### BlockHistorySize

```toml
BlockHistorySize = 8 # Default
```

BlockHistorySize controls the number of past blocks to keep in memory to use as a basis for calculating a percentile gas price.

### CheckInclusionBlocks

```toml
CheckInclusionBlocks = 12 # Default
```

CheckInclusionBlocks is the number of recent blocks to use to detect if there is a transaction propagation/connectivity issue, and to prevent bumping in these cases.
This can help avoid the situation where RPC nodes are not propagating transactions for some non-price-related reason (e.g. go-ethereum bug, networking issue etc) and bumping gas would not help.

Set to zero to disable connectivity checking completely.

### CheckInclusionPercentile

```toml
CheckInclusionPercentile = 90 # Default
```

CheckInclusionPercentile controls the percentile that a transaction must have been higher than for all the blocks in the inclusion check window in order to register as a connectivity issue.

For example, if CheckInclusionBlocks=12 and CheckInclusionPercentile=90 then further bumping will be prevented for any transaction with any attempt that has a higher price than the 90th percentile for the most recent 12 blocks.

### EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks = 13 # Example
```

EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks controls the buffer blocks to add to the current base fee when sending a transaction. By default, the gas bumping threshold + 1 block is used.

(Only applies to EIP-1559 transactions)

### TransactionPercentile

```toml
TransactionPercentile = 60 # Default
```

TransactionPercentile specifies gas price to choose. E.g. if the block history contains four transactions with gas prices `[100, 200, 300, 400]` then picking 25 for this number will give a value of 200. If the calculated gas price is higher than `GasPriceDefault` then the higher price will be used as the base price for new transactions.

Must be in range 0-100.

Only has an effect if gas updater is enabled.

Think of this number as an indicator of how aggressive you want your node to price its transactions.

Setting this number higher will cause the Chainlink node to select higher gas prices.

Setting it lower will tend to set lower gas prices.

## EVM.GasEstimator.FeeHistory

```toml
[EVM.GasEstimator.FeeHistory]
CacheTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

### CacheTimeout

```toml
CacheTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

CacheTimeout is the time to wait in order to refresh the cached values stored in the FeeHistory estimator. A small jitter is applied so the timeout won't be exactly the same each time.

You want this value to be close to the block time. For slower chains, like Ethereum, you can set it to 12s, the same as the block time. For faster chains you can skip a block or two
and set it to two times the block time i.e. on Optimism you can set it to 4s. Ideally, you don't want to go lower than 1s since the RTT times of the RPC requests will be comparable to
the timeout. The estimator is already adding a buffer to account for a potential increase in prices within one or two blocks. On the other hand, slower frequency will fail to refresh
the prices and end up in stale values.

## EVM.HeadTracker

```toml
[EVM.HeadTracker]
HistoryDepth = 100 # Default
MaxBufferSize = 3 # Default
SamplingInterval = '1s' # Default
FinalityTagBypass = false # Default
MaxAllowedFinalityDepth = 10000 # Default

PersistenceBatchSize = 100 # Default
```

The head tracker continually listens for new heads from the chain.

In addition to these settings, it log warnings if `EVM.NoNewHeadsThreshold` is exceeded without any new blocks being emitted.

### HistoryDepth

```toml
HistoryDepth = 100 # Default
```

HistoryDepth tracks the top N blocks on top of the latest finalized block to keep in the `heads` database table.
Note that this can easily result in MORE than `N + finality depth` records since in the case of re-orgs we keep multiple heads for a particular block height.
Higher values help reduce number of RPC requests performed by TXM's Finalizer and improve TXM's Confirmer reorg protection on restarts.
At the same time, setting the value too high could lead to higher CPU consumption. The following formula could be used to calculate the optimal value: `expected_downtime_on_restart/block_time`.

### MaxBufferSize

```toml
MaxBufferSize = 3 # Default
```

MaxBufferSize is the maximum number of heads that may be
buffered in front of the head tracker before older heads start to be
dropped. You may think of it as something like the maximum permittable "lag"
for the head tracker before we start dropping heads to keep up.

### SamplingInterval

> **CAUTION**
>
> ***ADVANCED***: *Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing.*

```toml
SamplingInterval = '1s' # Default
```

SamplingInterval means that head tracker callbacks will at maximum be made once in every window of this duration. This is a performance optimisation for fast chains. Set to 0 to disable sampling entirely.

### FinalityTagBypass

```toml
FinalityTagBypass = false # Default
```

FinalityTagBypass disables FinalityTag support in HeadTracker and makes it track blocks up to FinalityDepth from the most recent head.
It should only be used on chains with an extremely large actual finality depth (the number of blocks between the most recent head and the latest finalized block).
Has no effect if `FinalityTagsEnabled` = false

### MaxAllowedFinalityDepth

```toml
MaxAllowedFinalityDepth = 10000 # Default
```

MaxAllowedFinalityDepth - defines maximum number of blocks between the most recent head and the latest finalized block.
If actual finality depth exceeds this number, HeadTracker aborts backfill and returns an error.
Has no effect if `FinalityTagsEnabled` = false

### PersistenceEnabled

```toml
PersistenceEnabled = true # Default
```

PersistenceEnabled defines whether HeadTracker needs to store heads in the database.
Persistence is helpful on chains with large finality depth, where fetching blocks from the latest to the latest finalized takes a lot of time.
On chains with fast finality, the persistence layer does not improve the chain's load time and only consumes database resources (mainly IO).
NOTE: persistence should not be disabled for products that use LogBroadcaster, as it might lead to missed on-chain events.

### PersistenceBatchSize

```toml
PersistenceBatchSize = 100 # Default
```

PersistenceBatchSize is used to batch head tracker db transactions (inserts and deletes).
If set to 100, the head tracker will insert and delete to the db every 100 heads.
If the head tracker crashes before the batch size is reached (i.e it fails to write the current batch to the db).
Then it will have to load that batch of heads from the rpc on startup (check PersistenceEnabled above).
To limit that initial fetch while also improving db usage, 100 is the default for now.

## EVM.KeySpecific

```toml
[[EVM.KeySpecific]]
Key = '0x2a3e23c6f242F5345320814aC8a1b4E58707D292' # Example
GasEstimator.PriceMax = '79 gwei' # Example
```

FinalizedBlockPollInterval = '5s' # Default
EnforceRepeatableRead = true # Default
DeathDeclarationDelay = '1m' # Default
NewHeadsPollInterval = '0s' # Default
VerifyChainID = true # Default
ExternalRequestMaxResponseSize = 1000000 # Default
```

The node pool manages multiple RPC endpoints.

In addition to these settings, `EVM.NoNewHeadsThreshold` controls how long to wait after receiving no new heads before marking the node as out-of-sync.

### PollFailureThreshold

```toml
PollFailureThreshold = 5 # Default
```

PollFailureThreshold indicates how many consecutive polls must fail in order to mark a node as unreachable.

Set to zero to disable poll checking.

### PollInterval

```toml
PollInterval = '10s' # Default
```

PollInterval controls how often to poll the node to check for liveness.

Set to zero to disable poll checking.

### SelectionMode

```toml
SelectionMode = 'HighestHead' # Default
```

SelectionMode controls node selection strategy:

- HighestHead: use the node with the highest head number
- RoundRobin: rotate through nodes, per-request
- PriorityLevel: use the node with the smallest order number
- TotalDifficulty: use the node with the greatest total difficulty

### SyncThreshold

```toml
SyncThreshold = 5 # Default
```

SyncThreshold controls how far a node may lag behind the best node before being marked out-of-sync.
Depending on `SelectionMode`, this represents a difference in the number of blocks (`HighestHead`, `RoundRobin`, `PriorityLevel`), or total difficulty (`TotalDifficulty`).

Set to 0 to disable this check.

### LeaseDuration

```toml
LeaseDuration = '0s' # Default
```

LeaseDuration is the minimum duration that the selected "best" node (as defined by SelectionMode) will be used,
before switching to a better one if available. It also controls how often the lease check is done.
Setting this to a low value (under 1m) might cause RPC to switch too aggressively.
Recommended value is over 5m

Set to '0s' to disable

### NodeIsSyncingEnabled

```toml
NodeIsSyncingEnabled = false # Default
```

NodeIsSyncingEnabled is a flag that enables `syncing` health check on each reconnection to an RPC.
Node transitions and remains in `Syncing` state while RPC signals this state (In case of Ethereum `eth_syncing` returns anything other than false).
All of the requests to node in state `Syncing` are rejected.

Set true to enable this check

### FinalizedBlockPollInterval

```toml
FinalizedBlockPollInterval = '5s' # Default
```

FinalizedBlockPollInterval controls how often to poll RPC for new finalized blocks.
The finalized block is only used to report to the `pool_rpc_node_highest_finalized_block` metric. We plan to use it
in RPCs health assessment in the future.
If `FinalityTagEnabled = false`, poll is not performed and `pool_rpc_node_highest_finalized_block` is
reported based on latest block and finality depth.

Set to 0 to disable.

### EnforceRepeatableRead

```toml
EnforceRepeatableRead = true # Default
```

EnforceRepeatableRead defines if Core should only use RPCs whose most recently finalized block is greater or equal to
`highest finalized block - FinalizedBlockOffset`. In other words, exclude RPCs lagging on latest finalized
block.

Set false to disable

### DeathDeclarationDelay

```toml
DeathDeclarationDelay = '1m' # Default
```

DeathDeclarationDelay defines the minimum duration an RPC must be in unhealthy state before producing an error log message.
Larger values might be helpful to reduce the noisiness of health checks like `EnforceRepeatableRead = true', which might be falsely
trigger declaration of `FinalizedBlockOutOfSync`due to insignificant network delays in broadcasting of the finalized state among RPCs.
Should be greater than`FinalizedBlockPollInterval\`.
Unhealthy RPC will not be picked to handle a request even if this option is set to a nonzero value.

### NewHeadsPollInterval

```toml
NewHeadsPollInterval = '0s' # Default
```

NewHeadsPollInterval define an interval for polling new block periodically using http client rather than subscribe to ws feed

Set to 0 to disable.

### VerifyChainID

```toml
VerifyChainID = true # Default
```

VerifyChainID enforces RPC Client ChainIDs to match configured ChainID

### ExternalRequestMaxResponseSize

```toml
ExternalRequestMaxResponseSize = 1000000 # Default
```

ExternalRequestMaxResponseSize sets the maximum allowed size (in bytes) for responses to external requests.
Responses larger than this value will be rejected to prevent the node from being overloaded.
Only CRE workflow requests are considered external requests.
Only applies for RPCs configured with HTTP urls. There is no limit for WS only RPCs.
Set to 0 to disable the size check and allow responses of any size.

## Running a Chainlink Node (v1)
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node

# Running a Chainlink Node
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node


This guide will teach you how to run a Chainlink node locally using [Docker](#using-docker). The Chainlink node will be configured to connect to the Ethereum Sepolia.

> **NOTE: Running from source**
>
> To run a Chainlink node from source, use the [following
> instructions](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink#install). However, it's recommended to run the Chainlink
> node with Docker. This is because we continuously build and deploy the code from our repository on Github, which means
> you don't need a complete development environment to run a node.

> **NOTE: Supported networks**
>
> Chainlink is a blockchain agnostic technology. The [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page details networks which support the LINK token. You can set up your node to provide data to any of these blockchains.

Ganache is a mock testnet. Although you can run nodes on Ganache, it is not officially supported. Most node operators
should use one of the supported [testnets](/resources/link-token-contracts) for development and testing.

## Requirements

- As explained in the [requirements page](/chainlink-nodes/resources/requirements), make sure there are enough resources to run a Chainlink node and a PostgreSQL database.
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will run the Chainlink node and PostgreSQL in Docker containers.
- Chainlink nodes must be able to connect to an Ethereum client with an active websocket connection. See [Running an Ethereum Client](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client) for details. In this tutorial, you can [use an external service](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services) as your client.

## Using Docker

### Run PostgreSQL

1. Run PostgreSQL in a Docker container. You can replace `mysecretpassword` with your own password.

   ```shell
   docker run --name cl-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```

2. Confirm that the container is running. Note the `5432` port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) `0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp` and therefore accessible outside of Docker.

   ```shell
   docker ps -a -f name=cl-postgres
   ```

   If the container is running successfully, the output shows a healthy status:

   ```shell
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
   dc08cfad2a16   postgres   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   cl-postgres
   ```

### Run Chainlink node

#### Configure your node

1. Create a local directory to hold the Chainlink data:

   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>

     <Fragment slot="panel.1">
       ```shell Sepolia
       mkdir ~/.chainlink-sepolia
       ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

2. Run the following as a command to create a `config.toml` file and populate with variables specific to the network you're running on. For a full list of available configuration variables, see the [Node Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config) page.
   Be sure to update the value for `CHANGEME` to the value given by your [external Ethereum provider](/chainlink-nodes/resources/run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services).

   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>

     <Fragment slot="panel.1">
       ```shell Sepolia
       echo "[Log]
       Level = 'warn'

       [WebServer]
       AllowOrigins = '\*'
       SecureCookies = false

       [WebServer.TLS]
       HTTPSPort = 0

       [[EVM]]
       ChainID = '11155111'

       [[EVM.Nodes]]
       Name = 'Sepolia'
       WSURL = 'wss://CHANGE_ME'
       HTTPURL = 'https://CHANGE_ME'
       " > ~/.chainlink-sepolia/config.toml
       ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

3. Create a `secrets.toml` file with a keystore password and the URL to your database. Update the value for `mysecretpassword` to the chosen password in [Run PostgreSQL](#run-postgresql). Specify a complex keystore password. This will be your wallet password that you can use to unlock the keystore file generated for you.

   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>

     <Fragment slot="panel.1">
       ```shell Sepolia
       echo "[Password]
       Keystore = 'mysecretkeystorepassword'
       [Database]
       URL = 'postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable'
       " > ~/.chainlink-sepolia/secrets.toml
       ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

> **TIP: Important**
>
> Because you are testing locally, add `?sslmode=disable` to the end of your `DATABASE_URL`. However you should *never*
> do this on a production node.

1. Optionally, you can create an `.api` file with the credentials for the node's API and Operator Interface. The node stores the credentials from the `.api` file in the database only the first time you run the container using the database. The `.api` file cannot override credentials for an existing user in the database.

   Create the file in the same directory as your TOML config files and list your API credentials. Change the values for API email and password. The user must be an email address with an `@` character and the password must be 16-50 characters in length.

   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>

     <Fragment slot="panel.1">
       ```shell Sepolia
       echo "CHANGE_THIS_EXAMPLE_EMAIL
       CHANGE_THIS_EXAMPLE_PASSWORD
       " > ~/.chainlink-sepolia/.api
       ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

2. Start the Chainlink Node by running the Docker image.

   Change the version number in `smartcontract/chainlink:2.26.0` with the version of the Docker image that you need to run. For most new nodes, use version `2.0.0` or later. Tag versions are available in the [Chainlink Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags). *The `latest` version does not work.*

   Chainlink Nodes running `2.0.0` and later require the `-config` and `-secrets` flags after the `node` part of the command.

   If you created an `.api` file with your API and Operator UI login credentials, add `-a /chainlink/.api` to the end of the `docker run` command. Otherwise, the node will ask you for these credentials when you start it for the first time. These credentials are stored in the database only when you run a container for the first time against that database. If you need to remove the `.api` file, delete the container, and start it again without `-a /chainlink/.api`.

   <Tabs client:visible>
     <Fragment slot="tab.1">Sepolia</Fragment>

     <Fragment slot="panel.1">
       ```shell Sepolia
       cd ~/.chainlink-sepolia && docker run --platform linux/x86_64/v8 --name chainlink -v ~/.chainlink-sepolia:/chainlink -it -p 6688:6688 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway smartcontract/chainlink:2.26.0 node -config /chainlink/config.toml -secrets /chainlink/secrets.toml start
       ```
     </Fragment>
   </Tabs>

3. Detach from the container by pressing the Ctrl+P command and then the Ctrl-Q command.

4. Confirm that the container is running. Note that the `6688` port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) `0.0.0.0:6688->6688/tcp` and is accessible outside of Docker.

   ```shell
   docker ps -a -f name=chainlink
   ```

   If the container is running, the output shows a healthy status:

   ```shell
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                       NAMES
   867e792d6f78   smartcontract/chainlink:2.26.0   "chainlink node -con…"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:6688->6688/tcp, :::6688->6688/tcp   chainlink
   ```

5. You can now connect to your Chainlink node's UI interface by navigating to [http://localhost:6688](http://localhost:6688). Use the API
   credentials you set up earlier to log in.

   If you are using a VPS, you can create an [SSH tunnel](https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/) to your node for `6688:localhost:6688` to enable connectivity to the GUI. Typically this is done with `ssh -i $KEY $USER@$REMOTE-IP -L 6688:localhost:6688 -N`. An SSH tunnel is recommended over opening public-facing ports specific to the Chainlink node. See the [Security and Operation Best Practices](/chainlink-nodes/resources/best-security-practices) page for more details about securing your node.

## Configure users and roles

You can create several users with different [role-based access tiers](/chainlink-nodes/v1/roles-and-access). This allows you to grant access to several users without granting admin privileges to every user. Role-based access can be configured only by using the CLI.

1. Open an interactive bash shell on the container that is running your node:

   ```shell
   docker exec -it chainlink /bin/bash
   ```

2. Log into the Chainlink CLI. The CLI prompts you for the admin credentials that you configured for your node.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin login
   ```

3. Add a user with view-only permissions on the node. The CLI prompts you for the new user's credentials.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-view-only@test.com --role=view
   ```

   This user can now log into the UI and query the API, but cannot change any settings or jobs.

4. Confirm the current list of users:

   ```shell
   chainlink admin users list
   ```

5. Log out of the CLI. This prevents users with access to the shell from executing admin commands.

   ```shell
   chainlink admin logout
   ```

6. Exit from the container.

   ```shell
   exit
   ```

To learn how to modify user roles and see the full list of available roles, read the [Role-Based Access Control](/chainlink-nodes/v1/roles-and-access) page.

# Deploy Your First Smart Contract
Source: https://docs.chain.link/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract


## Overview

You can write your first smart contract and run it in your browser without any knowledge about Ethereum or blockchains. This guide shows you how easy it is to develop smart contracts using the [Solidity language](https://soliditylang.org/), a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io) and the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/). You can use all of these tools in your browser for free with no signup required.

## Objective

You will create and deploy a simple "Hello world" smart contract using the following process:

1. **Write:** Write a contract to define how the contract functions, what data it can store, what other contracts it interacts with, and what external APIs it might call.

2. **Compile:** Pass your smart contract code through a compiler to translate the contract into byte code that the blockchain can understand. For example, [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) code must be compiled before it can run in the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

3. **Deploy:** Send the compiled smart contract to the blockchain. From that point forward, the contract cannot be altered. However, you can still interact with the contract in several ways.

4. **Run functions:** When you run the functions that you defined for the contract, the network processes those functions and modifies the state of your contract. For some functions, the network charges a small fee to complete the work. Your contract can also have functions that transfer funds to other contracts or wallets.

This guide walks you through each step.

> **CAUTION: Disclaimer**
>
> This tutorial represents an example of using a Chainlink product or service and is provided to help you understand how

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Write, compile, and deploy your first smart contract" number={2}>
  Your first contract is a simple `HelloWorld.sol` example. This example shows you how to set and retrieve variables in a smart contract onchain.

  <CodeSample src="samples/Tutorials/HelloWorld.sol" />

  1. [Open the example contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/HelloWorld.sol) in the Remix IDE. Remix opens and shows the contents of the smart contract. You can modify the code in this editor when you write your own contract.


     <CodeSample src="samples/Tutorials/HelloWorld.sol" showButtonOnly />

  2. Because the code is already written, you can start the compile step. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings.

     ![Screenshot showing the Compiler tab and its settings.](/images/getting-started/selectSolidityCompiler.png)

  3. For this contract, use the default compiler settings. Click the **Compile HelloWorld.sol** button to compile the contract. This converts the contract from Solidity into bytecode that the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) can understand. Remix automatically detects the correct compiler version depending on the `pragma` that you specify in the contract.

     ![Screenshot of the Compile button.](/images/getting-started/compileHelloWorld.png)

  4. After Remix compiles the contract, deploy it. On the left side of Remix, click the **Deploy and Run** tab to view the deployment settings.

     ![Screenshot of the Deploy tab and its settings.](/images/getting-started/selectSolidityDeploy.png)

  5. In the deployment settings, select the **Injected Provider** environment. This tells Remix that you want to deploy your contract to the blockchain that you configured in MetaMask. You could optionally use one of the Javascript VM options, but they run in a virtual environment with no connection to an actual blockchain or Chainlink oracles.

     ![Screenshot showing the Injected Provider environment selected.](/images/getting-started/selectWeb3.png)

  6. Next to the **Deploy** button, enter a message that you want to send with the smart contract when you deploy it. This contract has a constructor that sets an initial message when you deploy the contract.

     ![Screenshot of the Deploy button with "Hello world!" as the defined message.](/images/getting-started/deployHelloWorld.png)

  7. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy the contract and its initial message to the blockchain network. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment to deploy the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

  8. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

     ![Screenshot showing MetaMask asking you to confirm the transaction.](/images/getting-started/confirmTransaction.png)

  9. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

     ![Screenshot showing the deployed Hello World contract.](/images/getting-started/deployedContract.png)

  10. Click the `message` variable. Remix retrieves and prints the initial message that you set.

      ![Screenshot showing the message function and the returned "Hello World" message.](/images/getting-started/runHelloWorld.png)

  The contract has an address just like your wallet address. If you save this address, you can return to your deployed contract at any time to retrieve variables or execute functions. To see details about your deployed contract, copy the contract address from the list in Remix and search for it in the [Etherscan Sepolia Testnet Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
</Accordion>

Now you know how to deploy example contracts to a test network and run the functions in those contracts. You can write your own contracts and test them using this same process.

Next, read the [Consuming Data Feeds](/data-feeds/getting-started) guide to learn how to connect your smart contracts to Chainlink Data Feeds and retrieve onchain data that your smart contracts can act on.

# Foundry Chainlink Toolkit
Source: https://docs.chain.link/quickstarts/foundry-chainlink-toolkit


## Overview

This toolkit makes spinning up, managing, and testing smart contracts and local Chainlink nodes easier using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) to deploy and test smart contracts. It can be integrated into existing Foundry projects.

## Objective

This project shows you how to install and run the simplify the development and testing of smart contracts that use Chainlink oracles. This project is aimed primarily at those who use the Foundry toolchain.

> **CAUTION: Disclaimer**

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Set up chain RPC node" number={2}>
  In order for a Chainlink node to be able to interact with the blockchain, and to interact with the blockchain using the [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/), you have to know an RPC node http endpoint and web socket for a chosen network compatible with Chainlink.
  In addition to the networks listed in [this list](/chainlink-automation/overview/supported-networks), Chainlink is compatible with any EVM-compatible networks.

  For local testing, we recommend using [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/), which is a part of the Foundry toolchain.\
  You can run it using the following command:

  ```
  make fct-anvil
  ```

  If the local Ethereum node is restarted, [re-initialize the Chainlink cluster](#initialize-testing-environment) or perform a [clean spin-up of the Chainlink nodes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/foundry-chainlink-toolkit/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#restart-a-chainlink-cluster) to avoid possible synchronization errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Initialize testing environment" number={4}>
  ```
  make fct-init
  ```

  [This command](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/foundry-chainlink-toolkit/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#initialize-test-environment) automatically initializes the test environment, in particular, it makes clean spin-up of a Chainlink cluster of 5 Chainlink nodes.

  Once Chainlink cluster is launched, a Chainlink nodes' Operator GUI will be available at:

  - [http://127.0.0.1:6711](http://127.0.0.1:6711) - Chainlink node 1
  - [http://127.0.0.1:6722](http://127.0.0.1:6722) - Chainlink node 2
  - [http://127.0.0.1:6733](http://127.0.0.1:6733) - Chainlink node 3
  - [http://127.0.0.1:6744](http://127.0.0.1:6744) - Chainlink node 4
  - [http://127.0.0.1:6755](http://127.0.0.1:6755) - Chainlink node 5

  For authorization, you must use the credentials specified in the [chainlink\_api\_credentials](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/foundry-chainlink-toolkit/tree/main/src/sandbox/clroot/settings/chainlink_api_credentials).

# Historical Price Feeds API
Source: https://docs.chain.link/quickstarts/historical-price-feeds-api


## Overview

This API endpoint allows you to fetch historical prices from Chainlink price feeds for a specified period. The API endpoint returns the price data in JSON format. You can use this API endpoint to fetch historical prices for a single round or multiple rounds.

## Objective

This example shows you how to set up and run a pre-built API that reads historical price data from Chainlink Price Feeds. The API runs offchain, but reads the data from onchain [Chainlink Data Feeds](/data-feeds). You can use this API to build your own applications.

## Before you begin

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 14.x.x
- Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) >= 1.22.x

## Steps to implement

<Accordion title="Write, compile, and deploy your first smart contract" number={2}>
  After you complete the setup steps, you can access the UI at `http://localhost:3000`. The API is available at `http://localhost:3000/api/price`.

  In order to fetch the price for a single round, you need to specify the same start and end timestamps. Make sure that the time frame exists. The API endpoint will return the price for the round that is within the specified time frame.

  ### Request a single-round

  Make a simple `curl` request to test the API:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3000/api/price?contractAddress=0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419&startTimestamp=1614556800&endTimestamp=1614556800&chain=mainnet&rpcUrl=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  {
    "description": "ETH/USD",
    "decimals": 8,
    "rounds": [
      {
        "phaseId": "1",
        "roundId": "1",
        "answer": "2000",
        "timestamp": "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"
      },
      {
        "phaseId": "1",
        "roundId": "2",
        "answer": "2100",
        "timestamp": "2021-03-01T01:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

## Reference

The endpoint for this API is `GET /api/price`.

<AnyApiCallout callout="usefunctions" />

In this guide, you will learn how to request data from a public API in a smart contract. This includes understanding what Tasks and External adapters are and how Oracle Jobs use them. You will also learn how to find the Oracle Jobs and Tasks for your contract and how to request data from an Oracle Job.

## How does the request and receive cycle work for API calls?

The request and receive cycle describes how a smart contract requests data from an oracle and receives the response in a separate transaction. If you need a refresher, check out the [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model).

For contracts that use [Chainlink VRF](/vrf), you request randomness from a VRF oracle and then await the response. The fulfillment function is already given to us from the `VRFConsumerBase` contract, so oracles already know where to send the response to. However, with API calls, the contract itself *defines* which function it wants to receive the response to.

Before creating any code, you should understand how Oracle jobs can get data onchain.

## What are jobs?

Chainlink nodes require [**Jobs**](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs) to do anything useful. In the case of a Request and Receive job, the [Direct Request](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs#direct-request-jobs) job monitors the blockchain for a request from a smart contract. Once it catches a request, it runs the tasks (both core and external adapters) that the job is configured to run and eventually returns the response to the requesting contract.

## What are tasks?

Each oracle job has a configured set of tasks it must complete when it is run. These tasks are split into two subcategories:

- [**Tasks**](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks) - These are tasks that come built-in to each node. (examples: http, ethabidecode, etc).
- [**External Adapters**](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) - These are custom adapters built by node operators and community members, which perform specific tasks like calling a particular endpoint with a specific set of parameters (like authentication secrets that shouldn't be publicly visible).

### Tasks

If a job needs to make a GET request to an API, find a specific unsigned integer field in a JSON response, then submit that back to the requesting contract, it would need a job containing the following Tasks:

- [HTTP](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task) calls the API. the `method` must be set to *GET*.
- [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) parses the JSON and extracts a value at a given keypath.
- [Multiply](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#multiply-task) multiplies the input by a multiplier. Used to remove the decimals.
- [ETH ABI Encode](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-abi-encode-task) converts the data to a bytes payload according to ETH ABI encoding.
- [ETH Tx](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-tx-task) submits the transaction to the chain, completing the cycle.

The job specs example can be found [here](/chainlink-nodes/job-specs/direct-request-get-uint256).
Let's walk through a real example, where you will retrieve 24 volumes of the [ETH/USD pair](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH\&tsyms=USD) from the cryptocompare API.

1. [HTTP](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task) calls the API and returns the body of an HTTP GET result for [ETH/USD pair](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH\&tsyms=USD). Example:

```json
{"RAW":
  {"ETH":
    {"USD":
      {
        ...,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO":953806939.7194247,
        "VOLUME24HOUR":703946.0675653099,
        "VOLUME24HOURTO":1265826345.488568
        ...,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) walks a specified `path` (`"RAW,ETH,USD,VOLUME24HOUR"`) and returns the value found at that result. Example: `703946.0675653099`

3. [Multiply](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#multiply-task) parses the input into a float and multiplies it by the 10^18. Example: `703946067565309900000000`

4. [ETH ABI Encode](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-abi-encode-task) formats the input into an integer and then converts it into Solidity's `uint256` format. Example: `0xc618a1e4`

5. [ETH Tx](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-tx-task) takes the given input, places it into the data field of the transaction, signs a transaction, and broadcasts it to the network. Example: [transaction result](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x10dd83b08ac2e2df1b1cc3c1615abb3287a4a9d29dad75f4c75f45a3a9dd819e)

**Note: Some tasks accept parameters to be passed to them to inform them how to run.** Example: [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) accepts a `path` parameter which informs the task where to find the data in the JSON object.

Let's see what this looks like in a contract:

    LinkTokenInterface link = LinkTokenInterface(_chainlinkTokenAddress());
    require(link.transfer(msg.sender, link.balanceOf(address(this))), "Unable to transfer");
  }
}
```

Here is a breakdown of each component of this contract:

1. Constructor: This sets up the contract with the Oracle address, Job ID, and LINK fee that the oracle charges for the job.
2. `requestVolumeData` functions: This builds and sends a request - which includes the fulfillment functions selector - to the oracle. Notice how it adds the `get`, `path` and `times` parameters. These are read by the Tasks in the job to perform correctly. `get` is used by [HTTP](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task), `path` is used by [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) and `times` is used by [Multiply](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#multiply-task).
3. `fulfill` function: This is where the result is sent upon the Oracle Job's completion.

**Note:** The calling contract should own enough LINK to pay the fee, which by default is 0.1 LINK. You can use [this tutorial](/resources/fund-your-contract) to learn how to fund your contract.

This is an example of a basic HTTP GET request. However, it requires defining the API URL directly in the smart contract. This can, in fact, be extracted and configured on the Job level inside the Oracle node. You can follow the *APIConsumer* tutorial [here](/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response).

### External adapters

If all the parameters are defined within the Oracle job, the only things a smart contract needs to define to consume are:

- JobId
- Oracle address
- LINK fee
- Fulfillment function

This will make your smart contract much more succinct. The `requestVolumeData` function from the code example [above](#contract-example) would look more like this:

```solidity
function requestVolumeData() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
    Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);

    // Extra parameters don't need to be defined here because they are already defined in the job

    return _sendChainlinkRequest(req, fee);
}
```

You can follow a full *Existing Job Tutorial* [here](/any-api/get-request/examples/existing-job-request).

**Connecting to any API** with Chainlink enables your contracts to access to *any* external data source through our decentralized oracle network. We understand making smart contracts compatible with offchain data adds to the complexity of building smart contracts. We created a framework with minimal requirements, yet unbounded flexibility, so developers can focus more on the functionality of smart contracts rather than what feeds them. Chainlink's decentralized oracle network provides smart contracts with the ability to push and pull data, facilitating the interoperability between onchain and offchain applications.

Whether your contract requires sports results, the latest weather, or any other publicly available data, the [Chainlink contract library](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts) provides the tools required for your contract to consume it.

> **NOTE: Note on Price Feed Data**

> If your smart contracts need access to price feed data, try using [Chainlink Data Feeds](/data-feeds).

## Methods

Below you'll find each helper explained in greater detail alongside respective implementation examples to help you leverage these methods once you start building your own Chainlinked contract.

After the function signature and a short description, two code examples are provided, one focusing on the exact usage of the method and one where the helper is presented in the context of a full contract.

### setChainlinkOracle

```solidity
function _setChainlinkOracle(
  address _oracle
)
```

Sets a private storage variable provided for convenience if your contract only needs to talk to one oracle and you do not want to specify it on every request. Once an oracle is set with `setChainlinkOracle` that is the address used with [sendChainlinkRequest](#sendchainlinkrequest).

Retrieve the oracle address using [chainlinkOracleAddress](#chainlinkoracleaddress). These getters and setters are provided to enforce that changes to the oracle are explicitly made in the code.

```solidity
constructor(address _oracle)
{
  _setChainlinkOracle(_oracle);
}
```

### setChainlinkToken

```solidity
_setChainlinkToken(
  address _link
)
```

Sets the stored address for the LINK token which is used to send requests to Oracles. There are different token addresses on different network. See [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) for the address of the LINK token on the network you're deploying to.

```solidity
constructor(address _link)
  public
{
  _setChainlinkToken(_link);
}
```

### buildChainlinkRequest

Use `buildOperatorRequest` [function](#buildoperatorrequest) if the oracle is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function _buildChainlinkRequest(
    bytes32 _jobId,
    address _callbackAddress,
    bytes4 _callbackFunctionSignature
) returns (Chainlink.Request memory request)
```

Instantiates a Request from the Chainlink contract. A [Request](#chainlinkrequest) is a struct which contains the necessary parameters to be sent to the oracle contract. The `buildChainlinkRequest` function takes an ID, which can be a [Job ID](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs), a callback address to receive the resulting data, and a callback function signature to call on the callback address.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  bytes32 jobId = "493610cff14346f786f88ed791ab7704";
  bytes4 selector = this.myCallback.selector;
  // build a request that calls the myCallback function defined
  //   below by specifying the address of this contract and the function
  //   selector of the myCallback
  Chainlink.Request memory request = _buildChainlinkRequest(
    jobId,
    address(this),
    selector);
}
```

### buildOperatorRequest

This function is similar to `buildChainlinkRequest`[function](#buildchainlinkrequest). One major difference
is that `buildOperatorRequest` does not allow setting up the address of the callback. The callback address
is set to the address of the calling contract.

It is recommended to use `buildOperatorRequest` but make sure the oracle you are contacting is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function buildOperatorRequest(
    bytes32 _jobId,
    bytes4 _callbackFunctionSignature
) returns (Chainlink.Request memory request)
```

Instantiates a *Request* from the Chainlink contract. A [Request](#chainlinkrequest) is a struct that contains the necessary parameters to be sent to the oracle contract. The `buildOperatorRequest` function takes an ID, which can be a [Job ID](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/jobs), and a callback function signature to call on the calling contract address.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  bytes32 jobId = "493610cff14346f786f88ed791ab7704";
  bytes4 selector = this.myCallback.selector;
  // build a request that calls the myCallback function defined
  //   below by specifying the function selector of myCallback
  Chainlink.Request memory request = buildOperatorRequest(
    jobId,
    selector);
}
```

### sendChainlinkRequest

Use `sendOperatorRequest` [function](#sendoperatorrequest) if the oracle is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function _sendChainlinkRequest(
    Chainlink.Request memory _req,
    uint256 _payment
) returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

Sends the request payload to the stored oracle address. It takes a [Chainlink.Request](#chainlinkrequest) and the amount of LINK to send amount as parameters. The request is serialized and calls `oracleRequest` on the address stored in `chainlinkOracleAddress` via the LINK token's `transferAndCall` method.

`sendChainlinkRequest` returns the ID of the request. If your application needs to, your contract can store that ID, but you don't need to. The ChainlinkClient helpers will store the ID under the hood, along with the oracle address, and use them when you call `recordChainlinkFulfillment` in your callback function to make sure only that the address you want can call your Chainlink callback function.

`sendChainlinkRequest` emits a [ChainlinkRequested](#chainlinkrequested) event containing the request ID, if you would like to use it in your Web3 application.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory request = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.callback.selector);
  uint256 paymentAmount = 1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY / 10; // Equivalent to 0.1 LINK

  // send the request that you just built
  _sendChainlinkRequest(request, paymentAmount);
}
```

### sendChainlinkRequestTo

Use `sendOperatorRequestTo` [function](#sendoperatorrequestto) if the oracle is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function _sendChainlinkRequestTo(
  address _oracle,
  Chainlink.Request memory _req,
  uint256 _payment
) returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

Similar to [sendChainlinkRequest](#sendchainlinkrequest), `sendChainlinkRequestTo` sends a [Request](#chainlinkrequest) but allows the target oracle to be specified. It requires an address, a Request, and an amount, and returns the `requestId`. This allows a requesting contract to create and track requests sent to multiple oracle contract addresses.

`sendChainlinkRequestTo` emits a [ChainlinkRequested](#chainlinkrequested) event containing the request ID, if you would like to use it in your Web3 application.

```solidity
function requestPriceFrom(address _oracle)
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory request = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.callback.callbackSelector);
  uint256 paymentAmount = 1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY; // = 1 LINK

  // send the request that you just built to a specified oracle
  _sendChainlinkRequestTo(_oracle, request, paymentAmount);
}
```

### sendOperatorRequest

This function is similar to `sendChainlinkRequest`[function](#sendchainlinkrequest).
It is recommended to use `sendOperatorRequest` but make sure the oracle you are contacting is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function sendOperatorRequest(
    Chainlink.Request memory _req,
    uint256 _payment
) returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

The `sendOperatorRequest` function sends the request payload to the stored oracle address. It takes a [Chainlink.Request](#chainlinkrequest) and the amount of LINK to send amount as parameters. The request is serialized and calls `operatorRequest` on the address stored in `chainlinkOracleAddress` using the LINK token's `transferAndCall` method.

`sendOperatorRequest` returns the ID of the request. Optionally, your contract can store the ID if your application needs it. The `ChainlinkClient` helpers store the ID and the oracle address and use them when you call `recordChainlinkFulfillment` in your callback function. This ensures that only the specified address can call your Chainlink callback function.

`sendOperatorRequest` emits a [ChainlinkRequested](#chainlinkrequested) event containing the request ID that you can use in your Web3 application.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory request = buildOperatorRequest(jobId, this.callback.selector);
  uint256 paymentAmount = 1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY / 10; // Equivalent to 0.1 LINK

  // send the request that you just built
  sendOperatorRequest(request, paymentAmount);
}
```

### sendOperatorRequestTo

This function is similar to `sendChainlinkRequestTo`[function](#sendchainlinkrequestto).
It is recommended to use `sendOperatorRequestTo`, but make sure the oracle you are contacting is an `Operator`
[contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol).

```solidity
function _sendChainlinkRequestTo(
  address _oracle,
  Chainlink.Request memory _req,
  uint256 _payment
) returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

Similar to [sendOperatorRequest](#sendoperatorrequest), `sendOperatorRequestTo` sends a [Request](#chainlinkrequest) but allows the target oracle to be specified. It requires an address, a Request, and an amount, and returns the `requestId`. This allows a requesting contract to create and track requests sent to multiple oracle contract addresses.

`sendOperatorRequestTo` emits a [ChainlinkRequested](#chainlinkrequested) event containing a request ID that you can use in your Web3 application.

```solidity
function requestPriceFrom(address _oracle)
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory request = buildOperatorRequest(jobId, this.callback.callbackSelector);
  uint256 paymentAmount = 1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY; // = 1 LINK

  // send the request that you just built to a specified oracle
  sendOperatorRequestTo(_oracle, request, paymentAmount);
}
```

### validateChainlinkCallback

```solidity
function validateChainlinkCallback(
    bytes32 _requestId
)
```

Used on fulfillment callbacks to ensure that the caller and `requestId` are valid. They protect ChainlinkClient callbacks from being called by malicious callers. `validateChainlinkCallback` allows for a request to be called

This is the method equivalent of the modifier `recordChainlinkFulfillment`. Either `validateChainlinkCallback` or `recordChainlinkFulfillment` should be used on all fulfillment functions to ensure that the caller and `requestId` are valid. Use the modifier or the method, not both.

`validateChainlinkCallback` emits a [ChainlinkFulfilled](#chainlinkfulfilled) event.

```solidity
function myCallback(bytes32 _requestId, uint256 _price)
  public
{
  validateChainlinkCallback(_requestId);
  currentPrice = _price;
}
```

> **CAUTION: Do not call multiple times**
>
> Do not call `validateChainlinkCallback` multiple times. The nature of validating the callback is to ensure the response is only received once and not replayed. Calling a second time with the same method ID will trigger a revert. Similarly, your callback should validate using either `validateChainlinkCallback` or `recordChainlinkFulfillment`, not both.

### addChainlinkExternalRequest

```solidity
function addChainlinkExternalRequest(
  address _oracle,
  bytes32 _requestId
)
```

`addChainlinkExternalRequest` allows a Chainlink contract to track unfulfilled requests that it hasn't created itself. For example, contract A creates a request and sets the callback for contract B. Contract B needs to know about the request created by contract A so that it can validate the callback when it is executed.

```solidity
function expectResponseFor(bytes32 _requestId)
  public
{
  addChainlinkExternalRequest(chainlinkOracleAddress(), _requestId);
}
```

> **CAUTION: Be careful adding external requests**
>
> Being able to change a request means that you can change the data fed into a contract. Permissioning someone to make external requests can allow them to change the outcome of your contract. You should be sure to make sure that they are a trusted to do so. If they are not trusted to do so, you should put the request making logic onchain where it is auditable and tamperproof.

### cancelChainlinkRequest

```solidity
function _cancelChainlinkRequest(bytes32 _requestId,
    uint256 _payment,
    bytes4 _callbackFunc,
    uint256 _expiration
)
```

In case an oracle node does not respond, it may be necessary to retrieve the LINK used to pay for the unfulfilled request. The `cancelChainlinkRequest` will send the cancel request to the address used for the request, which transfers the amount of LINK back to the requesting contract, and delete it from the tracked requests.

The default expiration for a request is five minutes, after which it can be cancelled. The cancellation must be sent by the address which was specified as the callback location of the contract.

For the sake of efficient gas usage, only a hash of the request's parameters are stored onchain. In order to validate the terms of the request and that it can be calculated, the request parameters must be provided. Additionally, cancellation must be called by the address which the callback would otherwise have been called on.

`cancelChainlinkRequest` emits a [ChainlinkCancelled](#chainlinkcancelled) event.

```solidity
function cancelRequest(
    bytes32 _requestId,
    uint256 _payment,
    bytes4 _callbackFunc,
    uint256 _expiration
) public {
  _cancelChainlinkRequest(_requestId, _payment, _callbackFunc, _expiration);
}
```

### useChainlinkWithENS

```solidity
function useChainlinkWithENS(
  address _ens,
  bytes32 _node
)
```

Allows a Chainlink contract to store the addresses of the LINK token and oracle contract addresses without supplying the addresses themselves. We use ENS where available to resolve these addresses. It requires the address of the ENS contract and the node (which is a hash) for the domain.

If your Oracle provider supports using ENS for rolling upgrades to their oracle contract, once you've pointed your Chainlinked contract to the ENS records then you can update the records using [updateChainlinkOracleWithENS](#updatechainlinkoraclewithens).

```solidity
address constant ROPSTEN_ENS = 0x112234455C3a32FD11230C42E7Bccd4A84e02010;
bytes32 constant ROPSTEN_CHAINLINK_ENS = 0xead9c0180f6d685e43522fcfe277c2f0465fe930fb32b5b415826eacf9803727;

constructor(){
  useChainlinkWithENS(ROPSTEN_ENS, ROPSTEN_CHAINLINK_ENS);
}
```

> **CAUTION: Updating oracle addresses**
>
> If an oracle provider supports listing their oracle on ENS, that provides the added security of being able to update any issues that may arise. The tradeoff here is that by using their ENS record, you are allowing whoever controls that record and the corresponding code it points to. If your contract does this, you must either audit the updated code and make sure it matches [Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) or trust whoever can update the records.

### updateChainlinkOracleWithENS

```solidity
function updateChainlinkOracleWithENS()
```

Updates the stored oracle contract address with the latest address resolved through the ENS contract. This requires the oracle provider to support listing their address on ENS.

This method only works after [useChainlinkWithENS](#usechainlinkwithens) has been called on the contract.

```solidity
function updateOracleAddressToLatest() public {
  updateChainlinkOracleWithENS();
}
```

> **CAUTION: Updating oracle addresses**
>
> If an oracle provider supports listing their oracle on ENS, that provides the added security of being able to update any issues that may arise. The tradeoff here is that by using their ENS record, you are allowing whoever controls that record and the corresponding code it points to.

### chainlinkTokenAddress

```solidity
function _chainlinkTokenAddress() returns (address)
```

The `chainlinkTokenAddress` function is a helper used to return the stored address of the Chainlink token. This variable is protected and so only made available through getters and setters.

```solidity
function withdrawLink() public {
  LinkTokenInterface link = LinkTokenInterface(_chainlinkTokenAddress());

  require(link.transfer(msg.sender, link.balanceOf(address(this))), "Unable to transfer");
}
```

### chainlinkOracleAddress

The `chainlinkOracleAddress` function is a helper used to return the stored address of the oracle contract.

```solidity
function getOracle() public view returns (address) {
  return chainlinkOracleAddress();
}

```

## Events

### ChainlinkRequested

```solidity
event ChainlinkRequested(
  bytes32 indexed id
)
```

Emitted when [sendChainlinkRequest](#sendchainlinkrequest) and [sendChainlinkRequestTo](#sendchainlinkrequestto) are called. Includes the request ID as an event topic.

### ChainlinkFulfilled

```solidity
event ChainlinkFulfilled(
  bytes32 indexed id
)
```

Emitted when [validateChainlinkCallback](#validatechainlinkcallback) or [recordChainlinkFulfillment](#recordchainlinkfulfillment) are called. Includes the request ID as an event topic.

### ChainlinkCancelled

```solidity
event ChainlinkCancelled(
  bytes32 indexed id
)
```

Emitted when [cancelChainlinkRequest](#cancelchainlinkrequest) is called. Includes the request ID as an event topic.

## Constants

### LINK\_DIVISIBILITY

`LINK_DIVISIBILITY` is a uint256 constant to represent one whole unit of the LINK token (1000000000000000000). It can be used with another value to specify payment in an easy-to-read format, instead of hardcoding magic numbers.

```solidity
uint256 constant private ORACLE_PAYMENT = 100 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY; // = 100 LINK
```

## Modifiers

### recordChainlinkFulfillment

`recordChainlinkFulfillment` is used on fulfillment callbacks to ensure that the caller and `requestId` are valid. This is the method equivalent of the method `validateChainlinkCallback`.

Either `validateChainlinkCallback` or `recordChainlinkFulfillment` should be used on all Chainlink callback functions to ensure that the sender and `requestId` are valid. They protect ChainlinkClient callbacks from being called by malicious callers. Do not call both of them, or your callback may revert before you can record the reported response.

```solidity
function myCallback(bytes32 _requestId, uint256 _price)
  public
  recordChainlinkFulfillment(_requestId) // always validate callbacks
{
  currentPrice = _price;
}
```

## Chainlink.Request

```solidity
library Chainlink {
  struct Request {
    bytes32 id;
    address callbackAddress;
    bytes4 callbackFunctionId;
    uint256 nonce;
    Buffer.buffer buf;
  }
}
```

The Chainlink Request struct encapsulates all of the fields needed for a Chainlink request and its corresponding response callback.

The Chainlink protocol aims to be flexible and not restrict application developers. The Solidity Chainlink Request model is a great example of that. It is exceptionally flexible, given the limitations of Solidity. The request can contain an arbitrary amount of keys and values to be passed offchain to the oracles for each request. It does so by converting the parameters into CBOR, and then storing them in a buffer. This allows for any number of parameters all of different types to be encoded onchain.

The request's ID is generated by hashing the sender's address and the request's nonce. This scheme ensures that only the requester can generate their request ID, and no other contract can trigger a response from an oracle with that ID. New requests whose IDs match an unfulfilled request ID will not be accepted by the oracle.

> **CAUTION: Intended for memory**
>
> The Request object was intended to be stored in memory. If you have a reason to persist the struct in storage, it is recommended that you do so by copying each attribute over and explicitly copying the bytes in the buffer.

| :-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [add](#add)                       | Add a string value to the run request parameters                 |
| [addBytes](#addbytes)             | Add a bytes value to the run request parameters                  |
| [addInt](#addint)                 | Add an integer value to the run request parameters               |

| [setBuffer](#setbuffer)           | Directly set the CBOR of the run request parameters              |

#### add

```solidity
function add(
  Request memory self,
  string _key,
  string _value
)
```

Add a string value to the run request parameters. Commonly used for `get` with jobs using `httpGet` tasks.

```solidity
function requestEthereumPrice()
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, this, this.fulfill.selector);

  req._add("get", "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=USD,EUR,JPY");

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, 1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY); // =1 LINK
}
```

#### addBytes

```solidity
function addBytes(
  Request memory self,
  string _key,
  bytes _value
)
```

Add a CBOR bytes type value to the run request parameters.

```solidity
function requestEmojiPopularity(bytes _unicode)
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, this, this.fulfill.selector);

  req.addBytes("emojiUnicode", _unicode);

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, LINK_DIVISIBILITY * 1);
}
```

Note that this can also be used as a workaround to pass other data types like arrays or addresses. For instance, to add an *address*, one would first encode it using `abi.encode` then pass the result to `addBytes`:

```solidity
Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, this, this.fulfill.selector);

req.addBytes("address", abi.encode(msg.sender)); // msg.sender used in this example. Replace it with your address

```

#### addInt

```solidity
function addInt(
  Request memory self,
  string _key,
  int256 _value
)
```

Add a CBOR signed integer type value to the run request parameters. Commonly used with the `times` parameter of any job using a `multiply` task.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, this, this.fulfill.selector);

  req._addInt("times", 100);

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, LINK_DIVISIBILITY * 1);
}
```

#### addUint

```solidity
function addUint(
  Request memory self,
  string _key,
  uint256 _value
)
```

Add a CBOR unsigned integer type value to the run request parameters. Commonly used with the `times` parameter of any job using a `multiply` task.

```solidity
function requestPrice()
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, this, this.fulfill.selector);

  req.addUint("times", 100);

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, LINK_DIVISIBILITY * 1);
}
```

#### addStringArray

```solidity
function addStringArray(
  Request memory self,
  string _key,
  string[] memory _values
)
```

Add a CBOR array of strings to the run request parameters. Commonly used with the `path` parameter for any job including a `jsonParse` task.

```solidity
function requestPrice(string _currency)
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(JOB_ID, this, this.myCallback.selector);
  string[] memory path = new string[](2);
  path[0] = _currency;
  path[1] = "recent";

  // specify templated fields in a job specification
  req.addStringArray("path", path);

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, PAYMENT);
}
```

#### setBuffer

```solidity
function setBuffer(
  Request memory self,
  bytes _data
)
```

Set the CBOR payload directly on the request object, avoiding the cost of encoding the parameters in CBOR. This can be helpful when reading the bytes from storage or having them passed in from offchain where they were pre-encoded.

```solidity
function requestPrice(bytes _cbor)
  public
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = _buildChainlinkRequest(JOB_ID, this, this.myCallback.selector);

  req.setBuffer(_cbor);

  _sendChainlinkRequest(req, PAYMENT);
}
```

> **CAUTION: Be careful setting the request buffer directly**
>
> Moving the CBOR encoding logic offchain can save some gas, but it also opens up the opportunity for people to encode parameters that not all parties agreed to. Be sure that whoever is permissioned to call `setBuffer` is trusted or auditable.

# Make a GET Request
Source: https://docs.chain.link/any-api/get-request/introduction


<AnyApiCallout callout="usefunctions" />

This series of guides explains how to make HTTP GET requests to external APIs from smart contracts, using Chainlink's [Request & Receive Data](/any-api/introduction) cycle.

## Examples

### Single Word Response

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response) explains how to make an HTTP GET request and parse the *json* response to retrieve the value of one single attribute.

### Multi-Variable Responses

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/multi-variable-responses) explains how to make an HTTP GET request and parse the *json* response to retrieve the values of multiple attributes.

### Fetch data from an Array

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/array-response) explains how to make an HTTP GET request that returns a *json* array and parse it to retrieve the target element's value.

### Large Responses

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/large-responses) explains how to make an HTTP Get request that returns a *json* containing an arbitrary-length raw byte data and parse it to return the data as *bytes* data type.

### Make an Existing Job Request

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/existing-job-request) explains how to call a job that leverages [External adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) and returns the relevant data to the smart contract. This allows building succinct smart contracts that do not need to comprehend the URL or the response format of the target API.

# Single Word Response
Source: https://docs.chain.link/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response


<AnyApiCallout callout="usefunctions" />

This guide explains how to make an HTTP GET request to an external API from a smart contract using Chainlink's [Request & Receive Data](/any-api/introduction) cycle and receive a single response.

## Example

This example shows how to:

- Fetch a single word response in a single call.

The [Cryptocompare GET /data/pricemultifull API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price\&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint) returns the current trading info (price, vol, open, high, low) of any list of cryptocurrencies in any other currency that you need. To check the response, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` or run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "RAW": {
    "ETH": {
      "USD": {
        "TYPE": "5",
        "MARKET": "CCCAGG",
        "FROMSYMBOL": "ETH",
        "TOSYMBOL": "USD",
        "FLAGS": "2049",
        "PRICE": 2867.04,
        "LASTUPDATE": 1650896942,
        "MEDIAN": 2866.2,
        "LASTVOLUME": 0.16533939,
        "LASTVOLUMETO": 474.375243849,
        "LASTTRADEID": "1072154517",
        "VOLUMEDAY": 195241.78281014622,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO": 556240560.4621655,
        "VOLUME24HOUR": 236248.94641103,
        ...
}
```

To consume an API with multiple responses, your contract must import [ChainlinkClient](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/ChainlinkClient.sol). This contract exposes a struct called `Chainlink.Request`, which your contract should use to build the API request. The request should include the following parameters:

- Link token address
- Oracle address
- Job id
- Request fee
- Task parameters
- Callback function signature

> **CAUTION: Note on Funding Contracts**
>
> Making a GET request will fail unless your deployed contract has enough LINK to pay for it. **Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link) and [Fund your contract](/resources/fund-your-contract)**.

Assume that a user wants to call the API above and retrieve only the 24h ETH trading volume from the response.

To use this contract:

1. Open the [contract in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/APIConsumer.sol).

2. Compile and deploy the contract using the Injected Provider environment. The contract includes all the configuration variables for the *Sepolia* testnet. Make sure your wallet is set to use *Sepolia*. The *constructor* sets the following parameters:
   - The Chainlink Token address for *Sepolia* by calling the [`setChainlinkToken`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinktoken) function.
   - The Oracle contract address for *Sepolia* by calling the [`setChainlinkOracle`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinkoracle) function.
   - The `jobId`: A specific job for the oracle node to run. In this case, you must call a job that is configured to call a public API, parse a number from the response and remove any decimals from it. We are going to use a generic ***GET>uint256*** job that can be found [here](/any-api/testnet-oracles/#jobs).

3. Fund your contract with 0.1 LINK. To learn how to send LINK to contracts, read the [Fund Your Contracts](/resources/fund-your-contract) page.

4. Call the `volume` function to confirm that the `volume` state variable is equal to *zero*.

5. Run the `requestVolumeData` function. This builds the `Chainlink.Request` using the correct parameters:
   - The `req._add("get", "CRYPTOCOMPARE_URL")` request parameter provides the oracle node with the [URL](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH\&tsyms=USD) from which to fetch *ETH-USD* trading info.
   - The `req._add('path', 'RAW,ETH,USD,VOLUME24HOUR')` request parameter tells the oracle node where to fetch the 24h ETH volume in the *json* response. It uses a [JSONPath expression](https://jsonpath.com/) with comma(,) delimited string for nested objects. For example: `'RAW,ETH,USD,VOLUME24HOUR'`.
   - The `req._addInt('times', timesAmount)` request parameter provides the oracle node with the multiplier `timesAmount` by which the fetched volume is multiplied. Use this to remove any decimals from the volume. ***Note***: The `times` parameter is mandatory. If the API that you call returns a number without any decimals then provide `1`as `timesAmount`.
     The `APIConsumer` in the example above is flexible enough to call any public API as long as the URL in *get*, *path*, and *timesAmount* are correct.

6. After few seconds, call the `volume` function. You should get a non-zero response.

## Operator Contracts

Testnet [Operator contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/contracts-v1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/operatorforwarder/Operator.sol) are deployed and maintained on the following networks:

| Testnet          | Oracle Address                                                                                                                  |

## Jobs

### Job IDs

To make testing simple, jobs are configured with the following properties:

- Each request on a testnet costs 0.1 LINK.
- Each oracle will wait for 1 confirmation before processing a request.
- Jobs have the same IDs across each testnet.
- Parameters are required. See [examples](#examples) for code snippets.

# Smart Contract Overview
Source: https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/conceptual-overview


Welcome to the Smart Contract Getting Started guide. This overview explains the basic concepts of smart contract development and oracle networks.

**Skip ahead:**
To get your hands on the code right away, you can skip this overview:

- [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract): If you are new to smart contracts, deploy your first smart contract in an interactive web development environment.
- [Learn how to use Data Feeds](/data-feeds/getting-started): If you are already familiar with smart contracts and want to learn how to create *hybrid* smart contracts, use Chainlink Data Feeds to get asset price data onchain.

## What is a smart contract? What is a hybrid smart contract?

When deployed to a blockchain, a *smart contract* is a set of instructions that can be executed without intervention from third parties. The smart contract code defines how it responds to input, just like the code of any other computer program.

A valuable feature of smart contracts is that they can store and manage onchain assets (like [ETH or ERC20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)), just like you can with an Ethereum wallet. Because they have an onchain address like a wallet, they can do everything any other address can. This enables you to program automated actions when receiving and transferring assets.

Smart contracts can connect to real-world market prices of assets to produce powerful applications. Securely connecting smart contracts with offchain data and services is what makes them *hybrid* smart contracts. This is done using oracles.

## What language is a smart contract written in?

The most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/). It was created by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented languages, Solidity is considered to be a *contract*-oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for smart contracts, such as [Solana in Rust](https://solana.com/docs/programs/rust) or Starknet in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/).

## What does a smart contract look like?

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript, with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to update the value of that variable.

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */
contract HelloWorld {
  string public message;

  constructor(
    string memory initialMessage
  ) {
    message = initialMessage;
  }

  function updateMessage(
    string memory newMessage
  ) public {
    message = newMessage;
  }
}
```

### Solidity versions

The first thing that every Solidity file must have is the Solidity version definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that are compatible with a range of versions.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
```

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma` selects the compiler, which defines how the code is treated.

### Naming a Contract

The `contract` keyword defines the name of the contract, which in this example is `HelloWorld`. This is similar to declaring a `class` in Javascript. The implementation of `HelloWorld` is inside this definition and denoted with curly braces.

```solidity
contract HelloWorld {

}
```

### Variables

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables. **State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in contract storage. The values of **local variables**, however, are present only until the function is executing. There are also different types of variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

*Visibility modifiers* are used to define the level of access to these variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility modifiers:

```solidity
string public message;
uint256 internal internalVar;
uint8 private privateVar;
```

Learn more about state variables visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-variable-visibility).

### Constructors

Another familiar concept to programmers is the **constructor**. When you deploy a contract, the constructor sets the state of the contract when it is first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets the `message` state variable to that string.

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}
```

### Functions

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named `updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.

```solidity
constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
  message = initialMessage;
}

function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
  message = newMessage;
}
```

Functions use visibility modifiers to define the access level. Learn more about functions visibility [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-visibility).

### Interfaces

An **interface** is another concept that is familiar to programmers of other languages. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. This makes it easier to know what functions to call in a contract. Here's an example of an interface:

```sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.7;

/**
 * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
 * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
 */
interface numberComparison {
  function isSameNum(
    uint256 a,
    uint256 b
  ) external view returns (bool);
}

contract Test is numberComparison {
  constructor() {}

  function isSameNum(
    uint256 a,
    uint256 b
  ) external pure override returns (bool) {
    if (a == b) {
      return true;
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

For this example, `override` is necessary in the `Test` contract function because it overrides the base function contained in the `numberComparison` interface. The contract uses `pure` instead of `view` because the `isSameNum` function in the `Test` contract does not return a storage variable.

## What does "deploying" mean?

**Deploying** a smart contract is the process of pushing the code to the blockchain, at which point it resides with an onchain address. Once it's deployed, the code cannot be changed and is said to be *immutable*.

As long as the address is known, its functions can be called through an interface, on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), or through a library like [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io), and more. Contracts can also be written to interact with other contracts on the blockchain.

## What is a LINK token?

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the [ERC20 token standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. It is used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators.

Any wallet that handles ERC20 tokens can store LINK tokens. The ERC677 token standard that the LINK token implements still retains all functionality of ERC20 tokens.

## What are oracles?

**Oracles** provide a bridge between the real-world and onchain smart contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act upon.

Oracles play a critical role in facilitating the full potential of smart contract utility. Without a reliable connection to real-world conditions, smart contracts cannot effectively serve the real-world.

## How do smart contracts use oracles?

Oracles are most popularly used with [*Data Feeds*](/data-feeds). DeFi platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) use Chainlink data feed oracles to obtain accurate real-time asset prices in their smart contracts.

Chainlink data feeds are sources of data [aggregated from many independent Chainlink node operators](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model). Each data feed has an onchain address and functions that enable contracts to read from that address. For example, the [ETH / USD feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd).

(Image: Chainlink Feeds List)

Smart contracts also use oracles to get other capabilities onchain:

- [Generate Verifiable Random Numbers (VRF)](/vrf): Use Chainlink VRF to consume randomness in your smart contracts.
- [Call External APIs (Any API)](/any-api/introduction): Request & Receive data from any API using the Chainlink contract library.
- [Automate Smart Contracts using Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation): Automating smart contract functions and regular contract maintenance.

## What is Remix?

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for creating, running, and debugging smart contracts in the browser. It is developed and maintained by the Ethereum foundation. Remix allows Solidity developers to write smart contracts without a development machine since everything required is included in the web interface. It allows for a simplified method of interacting with deployed contracts, without the need for a command line interface. Remix also has support for samples. This means that Remix can load code from Github.

To learn how to use Remix, see the [Deploying Your First Smart Contract
](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract) guide.

## What is MetaMask?

Contracts are deployed by other addresses on the network. To deploy a smart contract, you need an address. Not only that, but you need an address which you can easily use with Remix. Fortunately, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) is just what is needed. **MetaMask** allows anyone to create an address, store funds, and interact with Ethereum compatible blockchains from a browser extension.

## Acquire LINK Tokens
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/acquire-link

# Acquire testnet LINK
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/acquire-link


The Getting Started guides show you how to send ETH on the Sepolia testnet, but some contracts might require you to use LINK token instead. This page shows you how to obtain testnet LINK and send it to your MetaMask wallet.

## Configure MetaMask to use LINK tokens

To see your LINK token balance in MetaMask, you must manually add the token.

1. Open up MetaMask.

2. At the bottom of the MetaMask windows, click **Import tokens**.

3. Find the LINK token contract address for the network that you want to use. On Sepolia, the LINK token address is: `0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789`. See the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to find the addresses for different testnets.

4. Paste the token contract address into MetaMask in the Token Address input. The token symbol and decimals of precision will auto-populate.

   (Image: Metamask Custom Tokens Screen)

5. Click **Next**. A new window will appear, showing the LINK token details.

6. Click **Import Tokens** to confirm adding the new token.

MetaMask should now display the new LINK token balance.

## Get testnet LINK from a faucet

1. Go to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/).
2. In MetaMask, select the network where you want to receive testnet LINK.
3. Click **Connect wallet** so the faucet app can detect the network and wallet address.
4. If you want to receive testnet funds at a different address, paste it in the **Wallet address** section. This field defaults to your connected wallet address.
5. In the **Request type** section, select the testnet funds that you want to receive.
6. Complete the Captcha and click **Send request**. The funds are transferred from the faucet to the wallet address that you specified.

After the transaction is confirmed onchain, the faucet app shows "Request complete" and the transaction hash of your request.

## Bridge Risks

# Cross-chain bridges and associated risks
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/bridge-risks


When working with Chainlink on layer-2 chains and sidechains, you must export your LINK tokens from Ethereum to the target chain using a cross-chain bridge. Follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKvIGkBWRUA) for an example of moving LINK tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.

Cross-chain bridges come with their own risks. In fact, bridge attacks constitute some of the [largest cryptocurrency hacks](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) by value. When moving your LINK tokens or any asset across chains, understand the risks that you are taking with your assets. Chainlink Labs does not endorse any bridge. Ultimately, you are responsible for assessing the bridge that you use to move your assets.

Read the [What is a cross-chain bridge](#what-is-a-cross-chain-bridge), [Trade-offs](#trade-offs), and [Risks](#risks) sections to learn more about bridges and trust assumptions in their designs. After you read these sections, you will have a better understanding of bridge risks and which aspects you should evaluate when using a bridge.

## What is a Cross-chain bridge

With the [proliferation](https://defillama.com/chains) of layer-1 blockchains and layer-2 scaling solutions, the web3 ecosystem has become multi-chain. Each blockchain comes with its own approach to scalability, security, and trust.

However, blockchains are not natively capable of communicating with each other, which makes [blockchain interoperability protocols](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/) critical for allowing dApps to interact with any onchain network and tap into each blockchain's unique assets and features.

A [bridge](https://blog.chain.link/cross-chain-bridge/) is a core element of cross-chain interoperability. Bridges exist to connect blockchain networks and enable connectivity between them.

Bridges enable the following:

- Cross-chain transfer of assets and information
- dApps can leverage the strengths and benefits of different chains
- Collaboration between developers from different blockchain ecosystems to build new platforms and products for users

As an analogy, you can use [the blockchains as cities mental model](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/blockchains-are-cities-564327013f86):

- Layer-1 blockchains are like cities.
- Layer-2 solutions are equivalent to skyscrapers. As described in the mental model, “Each rollup is like a vertical blockchain that extends from the ground L1”.
- Bridges are like roads and streets that connect different cities and skyscrapers.

## Trade-offs

With the growing number of layer-1 and layer-2 chains, the number of bridges has also grown, [surpassing one hundred](https://debridges.com/). So, how do you choose the correct bridge?

When choosing a bridge, there is no perfect solution, only trade-offs. As explained in the [interoperability trilemma](https://blog.connext.network/the-interoperability-trilemma-657c2cf69f17) and [Ethereum foundation docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/bridges/#trade-offs), bridge designs must compromise between the following characteristics:

- **Trust-minimization:** The system does not introduce new trust or security assumptions beyond those of the underlying blockchains. Read [trust-minimization for more details](#trust-minimization-counterparty-risk).
- **Generalizability:** The system enables the transfer of complex arbitrary data. Data could be messages or assets/funds.
- **Extensibility:** How hard is it to integrate a new blockchain?
- **Latency:** How long does it take to complete a transaction?
- **Costs:** How much does it cost to transfer data across chains via a bridge?

## Risks

When choosing a bridge, be aware of the following risks.

### Smart contract risks

Bugs and vulnerabilities can expose users' assets to different kinds of exploits. Read this [detailed analysis](https://certik.medium.com/qubit-bridge-collapse-exploited-to-the-tune-of-80-million-a7ab9068e1a0) for an example of a bridge exploit where the attacker could leverage a logical error in the bridge’s smart contract.

### Systemic financial risks

To transfer tokens cross-chain, many bridges lock tokens on the source chain and mint derivative or wrapped tokens on the destination chain representing the locked tokens. A hack of the locked tokens or an infinite mint attack on the wrapped tokens can make all wrapped tokens worthless and expose entire blockchains to risk.

### Early stage

Given that bridges are relatively new, there are many unanswered questions related to how bridges will perform in different market conditions.

### Trust-minimization (Counterparty risk)

To overcome cross-chain interoperability challenges, some bridges use offchain actors or validators. These actors introduce new trust assumptions in addition to the underlying blockchain trust assumptions. These bridges act as a custodian and are, therefore, trust-based.
In contrast, some bridge designs rely on underlying blockchains' validators and, therefore, do not add any trust assumptions.
To summarize:

- Trusted (custodial) bridges require a third party to validate movements over the bridge. Users are required to give up control of their crypto assets, so trust is involved as they rely on the bridge operator's reputation.
- Trustless (non-custodial) bridges leverage smart contracts to store and release funds on either side of the bridge. These bridges are trust-minimized because they don't make new trust assumptions beyond the underlying blockchains.

Trustlessness in bridges does not exist in an absolute form (trusted vs. trustless). As explained in the blockchain-interoperability [blog](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/), there are four general interoperability solutions for validating the state of a source blockchain and relaying the subsequent transaction to the destination blockchain:

#### Web2 Verification

Web2 verification is when someone uses a web2 service to execute a cross-chain transaction. The most common example in practice is when users leverage centralized exchanges to swap or bridge their own tokens. The user simply deposits their assets into an address on the source chain that's under the control of the exchange and then withdraws the same tokens or different tokens (via a swap on the exchange) to an address on a destination chain controlled by the user.

Web2 verification can be fairly convenient for personal transactions and requires less technical expertise. However, it is limited only to swapping and bridging tokens which requires trust in a centralized custodian.

#### External verification

External verification is where a group of validator nodes are responsible for verifying transactions. These validators do not belong to either of the two blockchains’ validator sets and they also have their trust assumptions irrespective of the underlying blockchains.

External verification typically requires an honest majority assumption, where a majority of the external validator nodes must behave honestly for the integrity of the cross-chain interaction to be upheld. However, additional techniques can be used to increase trust-minimization, such as:

- Optimistic bridge verification
- Risk management networks
- Cryptoeconomic staking

Despite an additional trust assumption, external verification is currently the only practical way to perform cross-chain contract calls between certain types of blockchains while still providing trust-minimized guarantees. It’s also a highly generalized and extensible form of cross-chain computation that is capable of supporting more complex cross-chain applications.

> number of signatures or keys (m≤n). This means that an attacker only needs to exploit M keys to be able to hack the

> **NOTE: Optimistic bridges**

> Optimistic bridges rely on honest watchers to monitor the bridges' operations and report any risks. Because the

Here are some examples of externally verified bridges that use different techniques to increase trust-minimization :

- [Binance bridge](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/introducing-binance-bridge-20-421499824684903626) is a trusted bridge using the security standards of Binance.
- [Polygon POS bridge](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/) uses a proof of stake (PoS) consensus algorithm for network security.
- [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/nomad-101/introduction) is an optimistic bridge. It uses [optimistic verification](https://docs.nomad.xyz/the-nomad-protocol/verification-mechanisms/optimistic-verification) where messages are optimistically signed on the origin chain and a timeout period is enforced on the destination. During this period, a set of actors called watchers can inspect the messages and flag any detected risks.

#### Local verification

Local verification is when the counterparties in a cross-chain interaction verify the state of one another. If both deem the other valid, the cross-chain transaction is executed, resulting in peer-to-peer cross-chain transactions. Cross-chain swaps using local verification are often referred to as atomic swaps.

This model has a high level of trust-minimization given reasonable blockchain assumptions, as the swap either happens or both transactions fail. Furthermore, the model works so long as both parties are economically adversarial: they cannot collude to steal funds during atomic swaps.

Note that local verification is not very generalizable to a variety of cross-chain contract calls, and comes with tradeoffs like the [inadvertent call option problem](https://blog.bitmex.com/atomic-swaps-and-distributed-exchanges-the-inadvertent-call-option/) — a situation where the second party in an atomic swap can either act or not act on the swap, giving them an inadvertent call option for a certain period of time. Thus, local verification is mostly used in cross-chain liquidity protocols involving liquidity pools that exist independently on each chain.

[Hop](https://docs.hop.exchange/faq#what-is-hop-protocol) or Connext Legacy are examples of locally verified bridges.

#### Native verification

In this design, the validators of the destination blockchains are responsible for verifying the state of the source blockchain to confirm a given transaction. This is typically done by running a light client of the source chain in the virtual machine of the destination chain or running them both side-by-side. Native verification is the most trust-minimized form of cross-chain communication, but it is more expensive, offers less development flexibility, and is more suited to blockchains with similar state machines, such as between Ethereum and EVM-based layer-2 networks or only among Cosmos SDK-based blockchains.

The [NEAR Rainbow Bridge](https://near.org/blog/eth-near-rainbow-bridge/) is an example of a natively verified bridge. A smart contract with Ethereum light client functionality is deployed on the NEAR blockchain and a smart contract with NEAR protocol light client functionality is deployed on Ethereum. These light clients hold the latest block headers and verify that cross-chain transactions are done across both chains. The trust model relies only on Ethereum and Near validators.

## Fund Your Smart Contract
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/fund-your-contract

# Fund Your Contracts
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/fund-your-contract


Some smart contracts require funding at their addresses so they can operate without you having to call functions manually and pay for the transactions through MetaMask. This guide explains how to fund Solidity contracts with LINK or ETH.

## Retrieve the contract address

1. In Remix, deploy your contract and wait until you see a new contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
2. On the left side panel, use the **Copy** button located near the contract title to copy the contract address to your clipboard.

(Image: Image)

## Send funds to your contract

1. Open MetaMask.
2. Select the network that you want to send funds on. For example, select the Sepolia testnet.
3. Click the **Send** button to initiate a transaction.
4. Paste your contract address in the address field.
5. In the **Asset** drop down menu, select the type of asset that you need to send to your contract. For example, you can send LINK. If LINK is not listed, follow the guide to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of LINK that you want to send.
7. Click **Next** to review the transaction details and the gas cost.
8. If the transaction details are correct, click **Confirm** and wait for the transaction to process.

## LINK Token Contracts

# LINK Token Contracts

***

> **NOTE: Talk to an expert**
>
> <a href="https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=Contracts">Contact us</a> to talk to an expert about the networks that
> support the LINK token.

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20 token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

To use Chainlink services on a given blockchain, it is necessary to use LINK tokens. You can transfer tokens across blockchains by using [Chainlink CCIP](/ccip/tutorials/evm/transfer-tokens-from-contract) or applications such as [Transporter](https://app.transporter.io/) and [XSwap](https://xswap.link/).

### OP Sepolia Testnet

Testnet ETH is used to pay for transactions on OP Sepolia. Use the [OP Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to transfer testnet ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to OP Sepolia. Testnet ETH is available at [faucets.chain.link/sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia).

Testnet Native and LINK is available at [faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia). Testnet bridges might not transfer the correct type of LINK to OP Sepolia, so it is recommended to use only the LINK acquired from [faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia](https://faucets.chain.link/optimism-sepolia) when developing applications on testnet.

### Polygon Mainnet

POL is used to pay for transactions on Polygon. You can use the [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/) to transfer tokens to Polygon Mainnet and then use [Polygon Gas Swap](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/gas-swap/) to swap supported tokens to POL.

> **CAUTION: ERC-677 LINK on Polygon**
>
> The LINK provided by the <a href="https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/">Polygon Bridge</a> is not ERC-677
> compatible, so you cannot use it with Chainlink services or oracle nodes. Use the{" "}

{" "}

to convert bridged LINK to the official ERC-677 LINK token on Polygon.

# Integrating EVM Networks With Chainlink Services
Source: https://docs.chain.link/resources/network-integration


Before an EVM blockchain network can integrate with Chainlink, it must meet certain technical requirements. These requirements are critical for Chainlink nodes and Chainlink services to function correctly on a given network.

> **NOTE: Disclaimer**
>
> The standard EVM requirements required to integrate EVM blockchain networks with Chainlink services can vary, are
> subject to change, and are provided here for reference purposes only. Chainlink services may have unique requirements
> that are in addition to the requirements discussed herein.

## Standard EVM requirements

### Solidity global variables and opcode implementation

Solidity global variables and opcode implementation constructs must meet the following requirements in order for Chainlink services to operate correctly and as expected:

- **Global variables:** Support all global variables as specified in the Solidity [Block and Transaction Properties](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties) documentation. For example, the following variables must be supported:
  - `block.blockhash` must return the hash of the requested block for the last 256 blocks
  - `block.number` must return the respective chain's block number
  - `block.chainID` must return the current chain ID
  - `block.timestamp` must return the current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- **Opcodes:** Support all opcodes and expected behaviors from the [OpCodes.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/tests/solidity/contracts/OpCodes.sol) contract
- **Precompiles:** Must support all precompile contracts and expected behaviors listed in the Solidity [Mathematical and Cryptographic Functions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions) documentation
- **Contract size:** Must support the maximum contract size defined in [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)
- **Nonce:** The transaction nonce must increase as transactions are confirmed and propagated to all nodes in the network.

### Finality

Blockchain development teams must ensure that blocks with a commitment level of *finalized* are actually final. The properties of the finality mechanism, including underlying assumptions and conditions under which finality violations could occur, must be clearly documented and communicated to application developers in the blockchain ecosystem.

Furthermore, this information should be accessible through RPC API tags *finalized* from the [JSON-RPC specification tags](#support-the-ethereum-json-rpc-specification) described later in this document.

### Standardized RPCs with SLAs

Chainlink nodes use RPCs to communicate with the chain and perform soak testing. It is not possible to ensure the functionality of Chainlink services if RPCs are unstable, underperforming, or nonexistent. RPCs must meet the following requirements:

**Dedicated RPC node:**

- The chain must provide instructions and hardware requirements to set up and run a full node.
- The archive node setup must also be provided and allow queries of blocks from genesis with transaction history and logs.
- The RPC node must enable and allow configurable settings for the following items:
  - Batch calls
  - Log lookbacks
  - HTTPS and WSS connections

**RPC providers:**

- Three separate independent RPC providers must be available.
- RPC providers must ensure there is no rate limit.
- RPC providers must have a valid SSL certificate.
- During the trailing 30 days, the RPC providers must meet the following RPC performance requirements:
  - Uptime: At least 99.9%
  - Throughput: Support at least 300 calls per second
  - Latency: Less than 250ms
  - Support SLA: For SEV1 issues, provide a Time to Answer (TTA) of at most 1 hour

### Support the Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification

The chain must support the [Ethereum JSON-RPC Specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc). Chainlink services use several methods to operate on the chain and require a specific response format to those calls in line with the JSON RPC standard of Ethereum. If a response does not match this required format, the call fails and the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly.

The following methods are specifically required and must follow the [Ethereum RPC API specification](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/):

- [GetCode](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getcode)
- [Call](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_call)
- [ChainID](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_chainid)
- [SendTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendtransaction)
- [SendRawTransaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_sendrawtransaction)
- [GetTransactionReceipt](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionreceipt)
- [GetTransactionByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactionbyhash)
- [EstimateGas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_estimategas)
- [GasPrice](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gasprice)
- [GetTransactionCount](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_gettransactioncount)
- [GetLogs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getlogs)
  - Must follow the spec as defined in [EIP-1474](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1474.md?plain=1#L856). The "latest" block number returned by `GetBlockByNumber` must also be served by `GetLogs` with logs.
  - Must accept the `blockhash` param as defined in [EIP-234](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-234.md)
- [GetBalance](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getbalance)
- [GetBlockByNumber](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbynumber)
- [GetBlockByHash](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc#eth_getblockbyhash)

The above RPC methods must have the expected request and response params with expected data types and values as described in the [Execution-api spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/tests) and [Ethereum RPC API Spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/).

The network must also support the following items:

- **Subscription Methods:** [Websocket JSON-RPC subscription methods](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/pubsub)
  - `eth_subscribe` with support for subscription to `newHeads` and `logs`
- **Tags:** The RPC methods must support the `finalized`, `latest`, and `pending` tags where applicable. They must also support natural numbers for blocks.
- **Batch Requests:** Must support batching of requests for the `GetLogs` and `GetBlockByNumber` methods.
- **Response size:** Any RPC request including the batch requests must be within the allowed size limit of around 173MB.

### `eth_sendRawTransaction` error message mapping to Geth client error messages

Chains must provide an error message mapping between their specific implementation to the error messages detailed below.

When the `eth_sendRawTransaction` call fails, Chainlink nodes must be able to recognize these error categories and determine the next appropriate action. If the error categories are different or cannot be mapped correctly, the Chainlink node will stop functioning properly and stop sending transactions to the chain. The following error messages are specifically critical:

| Error                               | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NonceTooLow`                       | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is too low to use. This nonce likely has been already used on the chain previously.                             |
| `NonceTooHigh`                      | Returned when the nonce used for the transaction is higher than what the chain can use right now.                                                                |
| `ReplacementTransactionUnderpriced` | Returned when the transaction gas price used is too low. There is another transaction with the same nonce in the queue, with a higher price.                     |
| `LimitReached`                      | Returned when there are too many outstanding transactions on the node.                                                                                           |
| `TransactionAlreadyInMempool`       | Returned when this current transaction was already received and stored.                                                                                          |
| `TerminallyUnderpriced`             | Returned when the transaction's gas price is too low and won't be accepted by the node.                                                                          |
| `InsufficientEth`                   | Returned when the account doesn't have enough funds to send this transaction.                                                                                    |
| `TxFeeExceedsCap`                   | Returned when the transaction gas fees exceed the configured cap by this node, and won't be accepted.                                                            |
| `L2FeeTooLow`                       | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the gas fees are too low, When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried.  |
| `L2FeeTooHigh`                      | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. Returned when the total fee is too high. When this error occurs the Suggested Gas Price is fetched again transaction is retried. |
| `L2Full`                            | Specific for Ethereum L2s only. The node is too full, and cannot handle more transactions.                                                                       |
| `TransactionAlreadyMined`           | Returned when the current transaction was already accepted and mined into a block.                                                                               |
| `Fatal`                             | Return when something is seriously wrong with the transaction, and the transaction will never be accepted in the current format.                                 |

For examples of how other chains or clients are using these categories, see the [error.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/error.go) file in the [go-ethereum repo](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) on GitHub.

For chains with zk-proofs, chains must reject transactions that cause zk-proof overflow with a uniquely identifiable error message.

Any other reasons why transactions might be rejected by a node or sequencer other than malformed input/gasLimits must be detailed.

### Clarify use of transaction types

For [transaction types](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/types/transaction.go#L48-51) other than `0x0 - Legacy`, `0x1 - Access List`, `0x2 - Dynamic`, and `0x3 - Blob`, networks must clarify how each transaction type is used. Chainlink nodes must know if the chain uses other types for regular transactions with regular gas so it can correctly estimate gas costs.

### Multi-signature wallet support

The chain must provide a supported and audited multi-signature wallet implementation with a UI.

### Block explorer support

The chain must provide a block explorer and support for contract and verification APIs.

# Chainlink Local
Source: https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-local


**Chainlink Local** is an installable package that allows you to run Chainlink services locally. You can import Chainlink Local into your preferred local development environment,
such as Foundry projects, Hardhat scripts, or the Remix IDE. Chainlink Local enables rapid exploration, prototyping, local development, and iteration with Chainlink services
before transitioning to a testnet.

For instance, you can use Chainlink Local to execute CCIP token transfers and arbitrary messages on a local Hardhat or Anvil (Foundry) development node. Chainlink Local also supports forked nodes,
allowing you to work with multiple locally running blockchain networks using historical network states. User contracts tested with Chainlink Local can be deployed to test networks without modifications,
ensuring a seamless transition from local development to live testnets.

**Key Features of Chainlink Local:**

- **Local Simulation:** Run Chainlink services on a local development blockchain node, enabling fast and efficient testing and prototyping.
- **Forked Networks:** Work with deployed Chainlink contracts using one or multiple forked networks, providing a more realistic testing environment.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix IDE for a streamlined development process.

To get started testing CCIP with Chainlink Local, follow the installation and setup steps in the CCIP guides for [Foundry](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/foundry), [Hardhat](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/hardhat), or [Remix IDE](/chainlink-local/build/ccip/remix).

CCIP JavaScript SDK
Start here
The CCIP JavaScript SDK is a monorepo for two packages:
ccip-js
: A TypeScript library that provides a client for managing cross-chain token transfers that use Chainlink's
Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)
routers.
ccip-react-components
: A set of prebuilt ready-to-use React UI components. This package depends on
ccip-js
.
Using both packages, you can add a fully featured CCIP bridge to your app that can be styled to match your app design.
To view more detailed documentation and more examples, visit the
Chainlink Javascript SDK Documentation
. Development specific information is also found in individual READMEs inside the
./packages/<<PACKAGE_NAME>>
directory.
There is also an example implementation of a front end NextJS app that uses these packages in
./examples/nextjs
. That has its own README as well.
Prerequisites
Clone the
ccip-javascript-sdk
repo:
git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/ccip-javascript-sdk.git
Install
pnpm
.
Run
pnpm install
Run the example app
pnpm build
pnpm dev-example
Build packages
If you want to make changes to the package code, you need to rebuild the packages.
Then:
Make sure to build the
ccip-js
package before you build the
ccip-react-components
package. The React components depend on the JS package.
Make sure your client's package.json file to points to the updated local versions or use npm link or equivalent in your downstream client code. You can see examples of this in the steps below.
Follow these steps:
Build the
ccip-js
package:
pnpm build-ccip-js
Build the
ccip-react-components
package:
pnpm build-components
Update the
ccip-react-components
package to use the local
ccip-js
version by modifying
packages/ccip-react-components/package.json
file. Replace the
@chainlink/ccip-js
dependency with the workspace reference:
"
@chainlink/ccip-js
"
:
"
workspace:*
"
Update the
examples/nextjs
app to use both local
ccip-js
and
ccip-react-components
version by modifying
examples/nextjs/package.json
file. Replace the
@chainlink/ccip-js
and
@chainlink/ccip-react-components
dependency with relative path:
"
@chainlink/ccip-js
"
:
"
link:../../packages/ccip-js
"
,
"
@chainlink/ccip-react-components
"
:
"
link:../../packages/ccip-react-components
"
,
